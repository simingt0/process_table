# Instructions
You will be given the methods section of an animal toxicity paper, a list of groups derived from the text, and a paragraph containing animal toxicity data. Your goal is to extract each piece of data from the text in a standardized manner. Each piece of data should specify a treatment group, be the results of specifically an in vivo animal toxicity study, and be describing a summary statistic (ie. mean +- SD, 'hepatotoxicity seen in 12/20 of group') or observation of a toxicity biomarker (ie. 'significantly higher levels of lesions in treatment group'). Your answer should be a list dilineated by '|' for each piece of data, each on a new line. For each piece of data, complete the following steps to complete its list:
1. From the provided treatment groups, add the group name of the group that is being observed in this datum or the group the most closely resembles it.
2. Add the name of the biomarker observed.
3. Determine which type the observation is out of three options: numerical, frequency, and descriptive (output your choice as written here). Numerical is a discrete summary statistic, usually a mean and SD. Frequency is data describing how common a condition is within the treatment group population, usually a percentage or count. Descriptive data contains no numbers and simple states an observation of the treatment group specifically inferring a toxicity caused by a treatment.
4. Add the value of the data, omitting any units. If it is a mean +- SD, only include the mean, and write the observation verbatim if it is descriptive data. If the data is frequency and the sample size is included as well (ie. '4 out of the 10 mice'), write it in a fraction like so: count/sample_size (ie. 4/10). Remember that all numerical and frequency data should be numeric and description data should be text.
5. Add the observation value's units. If it is frequency data, choose out of the following: percentage, decimal, count. Percentage is a value between 0 and 100, decimal is a value between 0 and 1, and count is the number of subjects in the group with the condition. If the data is descriptive, put N/A here.
6. If the data is numerical, put the SD here. If there is no SD or if the data is frequency or descriptive, put N/A here.
The end format looks like this:
group|biomarker|type|value|units|SD
Do not include any other text or whitespace besides your answer. If a piece of information requested is not available in the paragraph, put N/A in its respective spot.
# Methods
Materials and methods
Animals
The animal experiments described in this publication were approved by the responsible authority (Landesuntersuchungsamt Koblenz, Approval-No. G 13-3-042).
Eight-week-old male and female Wistar Crl:WI (Han) rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany and acclimatized for 10 days. They were kept at 20-24  C at a humidity of 30-70% in groups of six animals in polysulfone cages (Tecniplast) with free access to water and feed (10 mm pellets, Provimi Kliba, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland).
Inhalation experiments
The animals were acclimatized to the whole-body exposure chambers for 2 days using the inhalation stream without the test substance. After this, rats were assigned randomly to the following test groups: Six rats of each gender and at each dose level were exposed to 0, 5, 10 or 20 ppm NVP for five consecutive days 6 h per day, all of this in analogy to the carcinogenicity bioassay (Klimisch et al.). As positive control rats were once treated orally with ethyl methanesulfonate [200 mg/kg body weight (bw) dissolved in saline (0.9% NaCl)] and killed 24 h later. Animals were weighed before the 2-day acclimatation to the exposure chambers and subsequently before and after the exposure to the test substance. Animals were killed in the morning after the last exposure period to perform the examinations described further down.
For the inhalation experiments, two animals per cage (DK III, Becker & CO., Castrop-Rauxel, Germany) were kept in the glass-steel inhalation chambers (volume approximately 200 L) without access to feed and water. For each test dose a constant amount of NVP was pumped by continuous infusion pumps PHD Ultra (Havard Apparatus, Holliston) to an evaporator (Glasverdampfer BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany; Thermostat Julabo Labortechnik, Seelbach, Germany). The thus generated vapor was combined with air and introduced into the exposure chamber. This atmosphere then left the chamber via a reduced pressure exhaust system in order to ascertain avoidance of spurious contamination of the laboratory air potentially caused by a leakage of the system. The NVP concentration in the inhalation atmosphere was monitored by GC/FID (Agilent 6890 with autosampler, Dionex Chromeleon Software, column: ZB-WAXplus, Zebron, injection temperature 250  C, flow rate 1 mL/min, carrier gas helium, FID detector, retention time about 4 min).
Preparation of animal tissues
Animals were anesthetized by 3.5% isoflurane (approximately 3 min, evaporator Drager Vapor 19.3) and then killed by cervical dislocation. The liver was removed and its left lateral lobe used for the Comet assay. The remainder of the liver was washed in saline and then in two aliquots shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80  C for later examinations. Subsequently the lung was removed from the dead animal. Its left lobe was used for the Comet assay and the remainder treated as described above for the liver. Thereafter the femora were removed for the preparation of the bone marrow.
Genotoxicity
Micronucleus test
Cellulose columns
13-mm filter disks with a pore size of 8 microm were placed on the bottom of 5-mL plastic syringes. Approximately 500 mg of a mixture consisting of equal parts microcrystalline cellulose (Sigmacell , Typ 50) and alpha-cellulose fibers was added up to the 2-mL mark.
Bone marrow preparation
Bone marrow preparation was performed according to published methods (Romagna and Staniforth; Salamone et al.). The soft tissue was removed from the femora and the epiphyses were cut off. The bone marrow was rinsed off the diaphyses with approximately 3 mL 37  C-warm fetal calf serum (FCS) (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) per femur, placed on the above-described cellulose column and eluted with 3 mL of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) (with Ca2+ und Mg2+). The eluate was centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min and the pellet was suspended in 50 mL FCS. From this suspension three portions per femur were individually placed on slides, air-dried and then stained for 4 min in May-Grunwald solution 1 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), followed by 4 min in May-Grunwald solution 2 (May-Grunwald solution 1 diluted 1:1 with aqua bidest.), rinsed in aqua bidest and then stained with Giemsa solution (7.5% dilution derived from Giemsa obtained from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 15 min. Subsequently, the slides were washed twice with aqua bidest, then dried, cleared in xylene and covered with Corbit-Balsam (I. Hecht, Kiel-Hasse, Germany).
Evaluation
2000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) per animal (1000 per slide) were evaluated at 1000-fold magnification under immersion oil for the presence/absence of large and small micronuclei as well as the proportion of PCE among the total erythrocytes. Statistical significance of differences between treated versus untreated groups was evaluated by the one-sided Wilcoxon test (using the program MUKERN). The result is regarded as positive when the following criteria are fulfilled: 1. The number of PCE with micronuclei is statistically significantly and dose-dependently elevated; 2. the number of PCE with micronuclei exceeds the number in the present negative control group AND in the historical negative controls. The result is regarded as negative when the following criteria are fulfilled: The number of PCE with micronuclei is not statistically significantly greater than in the negative controls of the actual experiment AND lies within the historical negative control values.
Comet assay
The Comet assay was performed under alkaline conditions according to the principles described by Singh et al. and Tice et al..
Preparation of single cell suspensions
Liver and lung cells were obtained essentially as described by Hartmann et al. and by the Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (JaCVAM). Single cells were obtained within 1 h after killing of the animals in order to minimize DNA damage during the preparation.
The organ parts (see above) were washed in mincing buffer (50 mM EDTA in HBSS [without Ca2+ and Mg2+] pH 7.5: DMSO 9:1 (v/v), the latter added shortly before use, stored at 4  C), cut into 1 to 2-mm pieces in ice-cold mincing buffer and transferred to a cell sieve with 70-microm pores. The viability of the cell suspension was evaluated by the Trypan Blue Assay (Strober).
Preliminaries to the electrophoresis
100 microL of the obtained cell suspension was mixed at 37  C with 900 microL Low Melting Agarose (LMA) (0.7% agarose in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] [Biochrom, Berlin, Germany] without Ca2+ and Mg2+). 100 microL of this mixture was transferred to a slide, which had been coated with Normal Melting Agarose (NMA) (0.6% agarose in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+). The slides were protected with a cover slip and the agarose was hardened at approximately 4  C. The cover slips were then removed and the slides put over night at 4  C into lysis buffer (2.5 M NaCl, 125 mM NaOH, 127 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris/NaOH, pH 10; 1% Triton X-100 and 10% DMSO (v/v), the latter two added before use) in order to lyse the cell membrane, nuclear membrane and remove the histone.
The then following procedures were performed in a shaded room to minimize UV-mediated DNA damage during the procedures.
Those slides which were destined to be treated with the DNA base excision repair enzyme FPG (Sigma Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) were washed (3 times for 5 min) with FPG buffer (0.04 M HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 M KCl, pH 8; add shortly before use bovine serum albumin [BSA] to a final concentration of 0.02%). Subsequently 50 microL FPG-enzyme-buffer (prepared shortly prior to use by 30-fold dilution of the following suspension in FPG buffer: 7 microL FPG-enzyme (14 U) and 70 microL glycerol in 623 microL FPG-Puffer, stored at - 80  C) was pipetted on the slide which was covered with a cover slide and incubated for 30 min at 37  C while being placed on a humid filter paper. After hardening of the agarose cover slips were removed.
Remaining lysis buffer or FPG buffer was removed by immersing/washing the slides in PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+).
Electrophoresis
The slides were then placed into the electrophoresis chamber, which was cooled and protected from light. Slides were covered with electrophoresis buffer (0.3 M NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, pH > 13) carefully avoiding air bubbles. The DNA was allowed to unwind (20 min). Thereafter the electrophoresis was started (25 V, 300 mA, 0.85 V/cm2, 30 min). The slides were then washed (2 times 5 min) in neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris/HCl, pH 7.5), dehydrated and fixed in 100% ethanol (1 min), dried at room temperature overnight and stored at room temperature protected from dust.
Evaluation
Quantitative evaluation of the Comet assays was performed by fluorescence microscopy after DNA staining with ethidium bromide. 40 microL of a 0.0005% ethidium bromide solution was pipetted on the electrophoresed DNA carrying slide, which was then covered with a slip and immersion oil was added for microscopy. Counting and evaluation of DNA (comets-shaped and non-comet shaped) was performed semiautomatically using Comet Assay IVTM (Perceptive Instruments, Bury St Edmunds) at intensity grade 2 of the fluorescence microscope. 100 cells were counted per animal and per organ on two separate slides (50 per slide). Each of the two slides was evaluated by a separate person. The criteria of the Comet standardization atlas (Nakajima et al.) were carefully followed such as avoiding the inclusion into the evaluation of cells on the border of the slide as well as hedgehogs (diffuse cells without a discernible head). Hedgehogs were counted separately.
As basis for the evaluation of the DNA damage the relative tail intensity (TI) was used, providing relative fluorescence intensity in the tail and thus information on the amount of DNA in the tail which is linearly related to the amount of DNA strand breaks. Therefore, this parameter is recommended for DNA damage evaluation within the Comet assay (Collins et al.,; Hartmann et al.,; Lovell & Omori,). For obtaining the TI of the individual animal and organ the mean of the median TI per slide was calculated. These mean TI values per organ and animal were used to calculate the mean TI value per dose group.
A test substance is regarded as positive in the Comet assay, if the mean of the TI is dose-dependently increased and if the mean of the TI of a dose group is increased by a factor of 2 above the vehicle-only control group of the actual experiment. In difficult cases, if there is only a slight increase of the TI of some of the animals of the dose group, the decision is taken case by case. A statistical evaluation (two-sided t-test) was taken into consideration.
Oxidative stress
Non-protein-bound sulfhydryl groups (NPSH)
Determination of NPSH was performed according to the principle described by Ellmann (1958, 1959) in the liver homogenate supernatant fraction of the NVP-exposed male Wistar rats. One g liver was homogenized at 0  C in 9 mL of a 5% (weight/volume) aqueous 5-sulfosalicylic acid (5-SSA) solution, followed by centrifugation (14 000 g, 10 min, 4  C). The supernatant fraction was stored in aliqots at - 80  C. Prior to assay, the samples were diluted fourfold and to 100 microL of the diluted sample 200 microL Tris/EDTA (1 M/5 mM, pH 8.9) buffer was added. Determinations were performed in triplicates. As quality control 480 microM GSH was used, which was diluted by a factor of 5 for application in the assay. Reaction was started by addition of 5 microL of Ellmann's reagent (10 mM 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid [DTNB] in methanol, freshly prepared every day). Measurements were performed 5 min thereafter at lambda = 412 nm.
Glutathione recycling assay
Glutathione recycling assay was adapted from the method described by Gallagher and performed using the 14 000 g supernatant fraction derived from the 5-SSA-treated liver homogenate of the NVP-exposed male Wistar rats as described above under "Non-protein-bound sulfhydryl groups". The obtained samples were diluted fivefold with the 5% 5-SSA solution.
For determination of total glutathione (tGSH, i.e. GSH + GSSG) a GSH control (640 microM in 5% 5-SSA, diluted by a factor of 4 for application in the assay) and a tGSH control (200 microM in 5% 5-SSA, containing 10% GSSG) were treated the same way as the samples. To 5 microL of sample, controls as well as GSH standards (dissolved in 5% 5-SSA solution) 190 microL tGSH master mix, consisting of phosphate/EDTA buffer (125 mM KH2PO4/7 mM EDTA, pH 7.5), 0.4 mM NADPH and 0.5 U/L glutathione reductase suspension, were added. Determinations were performed in triplicates. The reaction was started by adding 5 microL of 24 mM DTNB in methanol. The absorption at lambda = 412 nm was measured every 60 s for 5 min.
For determination of GSSG a control (20 muM GSSG, 160 muM GSH) was treated the same way as the samples. 125 microL sample, control, GSSG standards and blank, respectively, were combined with 5 microL 2-vinylpyridine (Sigma Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). 20 microL of 7.4 mM triethylamine was pipetted to the upper rim of the vessel such that after mixing the pH value was between 7 and 7.5 and reaction was allowed to proceed in the thermomixer at 600 rpm for 1 h at 26  C in order to derivatize the GSH in the sample. The determination of GSSG was then performed in analogy to the determination of tGSH described above. The absorption at lambda = 412 nm was measured every 60 s for 10 min.
Receptor-mediated mechanisms
Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnan X receptor (PXR): Alkoxyresorufin O-dealkylase assays
The alkoxyresorufin dealkylase (AROD) assays were based on the method by Burke et al..
The frozen livers and lungs of the NVP-treated male Wistar rats were thawed and washed with isotonic (0.9%) NaCl solution. The tissues were ice-cooled homogenized (1 g tissue: 3 mL 0.25 M saccharose in 1 mM disodium EDTA, pH 7.4) and centrifuged (9000 g, 15 min, 4  C). The supernatant fraction was centrifuged (100 000 g, 60 min, 4  C). The resulting supernatant fraction was used for the palmitoyl-CoA-oxidase assay described further down. The pellet was taken up in 150 mM aqueous KCl solution, recentrifuged (100 000 g, 60 min, 4  C) and the pellet taken up in 1 mL/g liver or 0.5 mL/g lung resuspension buffer (1 mM GSH, 1 mM disodium EDTA, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M KH2PO4, pH 7.5 and 4% glycerol). Aliquots were stored at - 80  C.
For determination of the enzyme activities in triplicates, 85 microL master mix (100 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 2 mM 5'AMP, 5 mM G-6-P, 10 U G-6-P-DH, 10 mM Dicumarol, 10 mM MgCl2, either 2 microM EROD or 10 microM PROD or 5 microM BROD) was added to 10 microL microsomal fraction (1 mg protein/mL). The reaction was started by the addition of 5 microL 2 mM NADPH (dissolved in 100 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5) followed by incubation at 37  C for 16 min. The activity was determined by measuring the increase of the fluorescence (excitation at 550 nm, emission at 585 nm) due to resorufin formation compared with resorufin standards, which had been prepared by dissolving tenfold concentrated solutions in DMSO, which were then diluted tenfold in 100 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5.
As a method control the described AROD assay was performed with microsomal fractions derived from liver and lung of male Wistar rats which had been treated i.p. for 5 days with aroclor 1254 (500 mg/kg bw). These control assays were performed in presence of 1 muM, 10 muM or 100 muM NVP, respectively, in order to check for potential interactions of NVP with the substrate turnover in the AROD assay.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha):
a) Lauric acid hydroxylase assay
14C-labelled lauric acid (55 mCi/mmol) dissolved in ethanol (0.1 mCi/mL; total volume 2.5 mL) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. 10 microL of this solution were diluted with methanol to 2 mL. The purity was checked by radio-HPLC. For the enzyme activity determinations 1.21 mL of this solution were treated in the thermomixer at 40  C and 300 rpm until the ethanol was completely evaporated. The residue was taken up in 550 microL DMSO and checked on the incubation days by radio-HPLC and by liquid scintillation counting (LSC). To this end the just-mentioned solution in DMSO (nominally 8.14 MBq/mL) was 100-fold diluted with methanol, 50 microL of the resultant solution used for the HPLC analysis, 100 microL for the LSC analysis (488,400 dpm/100 microL).
For the determination of the lauric acid hydroxylase activity the liver microsomal fractions (prepared as described in the preceding chapter "Aryl hydrocarbon receptor") derived from the NVP-treated (and untreated control) male rats were adjusted with TrisHCl pH 7.5-20 mg protein/mL. Obtained samples were measured in duplicates. Controls were heat-denatured samples (15 min at 99  C in the thermomixer at 450 rpm), zero-time samples (reaction stopped immediately after adding substrate) and buffer controls (TrisHCl pH 7.5, no microsomal protein). 155 microL master mix (100 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM 5'AMP-Na2, 5 mM G-6-P, 10 U G-6-P-DH) and 30 microL sample were preincubated for 3 min at 37  C. Subsequently 10 microL of a 2-mM NADPH solution and 5 microL 14C-lauric acid (8.14 MBq/mL) were added (lauric acid final concentration in the incubation 100 microM). The reaction was run for 20 min at 37  C in the thermomixer (450 rpm) and stopped by the addition of 200 microL ice-cold acetone. Proteins were sedimented by centrifugation (6000 g, 10 min, 4  C) and the supernatant used for the analysis by HPLC (system: Agilent 1260 infinity, column: EC250/4 Nucleosil, 120-5 C18, radio detector: Berthold FlowStar LB 513) under the following conditions: Injection volume 50 microL; eluent A: Methanol/acetic acid/water (600/5/400 mL), eluent B: Methanol; gradient: 0-10 min 100% eluent A, 10-20 min 0-100% eluent B, 20-30 min 100% eluent B, 30-40 min 100% eluent A; flow rate: 0.8 mL/min. In order to ascertain the assignment of the peaks to 11-hydroxylauric acid versus 12-hydroxylauric acid the retention times and mass spectra (HPLC-QTOF/MS) of a 12-hydroxylauric acid standard were compared with the lauric acid incubates (parameters of the HPLC-QTOF/MS system: (U)HPLC: Agilent 1200 und 1290; MS instrument: MS324/Agilent/S/N US10318001; radio detector: Raytest/Mirastar Masshunter Data Acquisition B.06.01; ionisation mode: ESI, negative mode).
b) Palmitoyl-CoA oxidase assay
Cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl-CoA oxidase was determined essentially according to the method by Lazarow, specifically as follows:
Five microL of the liver cytosol (prepared as described in the preceding chapter "Aryl hydrocarbon receptor") derived from the NVP-treated (and untreated control) male rats were mixed in a centrifugal analyzer Cobas Fara II (Hoffmann La Roche) with 250 microL reaction mixture consisting of 28.2 mL 50 mM Tris buffer pH 8.01, 150 microL 2% Triton-X-100, 300 microL 1 mM FAD, 300 microL 10 mM CoA, 150 microL 1.5% BSA, 90 microL 0.33 mM dithiothreitol, 300 microL 20 mM NAD and after homogenization 300 microL 100 mM KCN. The reaction was started by adding 5 microL of 5.03 microM palmitoyl-CoA aqueous solution. The increase of the absorption at y = 334 nm due to NADH formation was determined and translated to palmitoyl-CoA oxidase U/L by the Cobas Fara II software.
Protein quantification and determination of levels of detection (LOD) and levels of quantitation (LOQ)
Protein was determined according to the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as standard except for the palmitoyl-CoA-oxidase assay where the Biuret method was used according to Gornall et al..
The limit of detection (LOD) was determined by adding 3 standard deviations (SDs) to the mean of the individual results. The limit of quantification was determined by multiplying the LOD by 2 (Gottwald).
Histological investigations of the liver
Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining
HE staining was performed essentially according to Romeis, specifically under the following conditions:
Parts of the frozen (- 80  C) livers from rats treated with 0, 5, 10 or 20 ppm NVP were thawed in formalin (specifically 4% formaldehyde in sodium phosphate buffer pH 7) and left therein for fixation at least 7 days. Subsequently the livers were cut into approximately 4 mm-thick slices, which were dehydrated in increasingly concentrated ethanol (70-100%), washed in xylene and then transferred into fluid paraffin. The livers were put into kassettes with the parts which were foreseen for cutting toward the bottom, the kassettes filled with paraplast (melting point 58-62  C) and the material left for hardening. From the embedded livers 3- to 6 microm-thick slices were cut by a rotation microtome, then stretched (in a water bath at 45  C), transferred to a slide and dried overnight at 50  C. Subsequently the slices were stained with HE and covered with Pertex. The slices were then microscopically evaluated. Structural changes were classified into severity grades 0, 1, 2 and 3.
Oil Red O (ORO) staining
ORO staining was performed essentially according to Lillie and Ashburn, specifically under the following conditions:
Parts of the frozen (- 80  C) livers from rats treated with 0, 5, 10 or 20 ppm NVP were soaked in tap water and then thoroughly frozen at - 40  C. Subsequently they were cut at -10 to -15  C into slices of 12-20 microm and stored in water until starting the staining procedure. The slices were then left for approximately 5 min in 60% isopropanol, subsequently stained for 10-12 min in ORO solution (5 g ORO dissolved in 1 L isopropanol, to this solution added 400 mL H2O, left at room temperature for 24 h and then filtered) and subsequently differentiated by immersing 2-3 times into 60% isopropanol. Afterwards they were left in water until they collected at the surface. Finally the slices were stained for 3 min in hematoxylin solution (1 g hematoxylin, 50 g KAl(SO4)2, 50 g chloral hydrate, 1 g citric acid/L H2O, then for maturation 0.2 g NaIO3/L). Subsequently they were left at least 10 min in water. Finally, the slices were transferred to microscope slides and covered with 40-60  C warm Kaiser's glycerol gelatin.
Gene expression analysis in cultivated rat hepatocytes
Isolation and cultivation of primary rat hepatocytes was performed according to a published standard operation procedure (Godoy et al. ) and Affymetrix gene array analysis as described in Grinberg et al.. Briefly, male Wistar rats with a body weight of 220-300 g were purchased from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). The animals had free access to food (sniff, Soest, Germany) and water and were kept under controlled temperature (18-26  C), humidity (30-70%) and lighting (12 h light/dark circle). Prior to any experimental procedure, the animals were acclimated for a minimum of 6 days. This study was approved by the local committee for the welfare of experimental animals and was performed in accordance with national legislation. RNA was extracted from cultivated primary hepatocytes as described by Heise et al.. Incubation of the cultivated rat hepatocytes with the test compounds was performed for 24 h. Rat hepatocytes were cultivated as sandwich cultures using 6well dishes. Three independent incubations with the test compound were performed. For Affymetrix gene chip analysis samples isolated from the 6-well dishes were stored in RNAprotect reagent from Qiagen until isolation of RNA. The RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop N-1000 spectrophotometer, and the integrity of RNA was confirmed with a standard sense automated gel electrophoresis system. Samples were used for transcriptional profiling only when their RNA quality indicator (RQI) number was > 8. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng total RNA using an oligo-dT primer with an attached T7 promoter sequence, followed by the complementary second strand. The double-stranded cDNA molecule was used for in vitro transcription (IVT, standard Affymetrix procedure) using Genechip 3' IVT Express Kit. During synthesis of the aRNA (amplified RNA, also commonly referred to as cRNA), a biotinylated nucleotide analogue was incorporated, which served as a label for the message. After amplification, aRNA was purified with magnetic beads and 15 microg of aRNA was fragmented with the fragmentation buffer as per the manufacturer's instructions. Then 12.5 microg fragmented aRNA was hybridized with Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Arrays. The chips were placed in a GeneChip Hybridization Oven-645 for 16 h at 60 rpm and 45  C. For staining and washing, Affymetrix HWS kits were used on a Genechip Fluidics Station-450. For scanning, the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner-3000-7G was used, and the image and quality control assessments were performed with Affymetrix GCOS software. All reagents and instruments were acquired from Affymetrix (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The generated CEL files were used for further statistical analysis as described in Grinberg et al., 2018).

# Paragraph
{'title': 'Histology', 'text': 'Histological examinations were not planned in this study, but in some livers of the males high-dose group there were already macroscopically some light spots visible. Therefore, the livers of three animals per dose and gender were histologically examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining. In most livers of the NVP-exposed rats centrilobular hepatocellular fatty change was noticed (but in none of the controls) (Fig. 2). This was the case in all males, except two of three investigated males in the low dose (5 ppm) group. In the intermediate dose (10 ppm) group, two of three males showed low-grade (grade 1) centrilobular hepatocellular fatty change, and in the high-dose (20 ppm) group, two of three males showed high-grade (grade 3) centrilobular hepatocellular fatty change. Females showed weaker effects: In one of three females of the high-dose group there was grade 1 centrilobular hepatocellular fatty change, and in one female of the high-dose group there was grade 2 centrilobular hepatocellular fatty change.', 'label': True}
