# Instructions
You will be given the methods section of an animal toxicity paper, a list of groups derived from the text, and a paragraph containing animal toxicity data. Your goal is to extract each piece of data from the text in a standardized manner. Each piece of data should specify a treatment group, be the results of specifically an in vivo animal toxicity study, and be describing a summary statistic (ie. mean +- SD, 'hepatotoxicity seen in 12/20 of group') or observation of a toxicity biomarker (ie. 'significantly higher levels of lesions in treatment group'). Your answer should be a list dilineated by '|' for each piece of data, each on a new line. For each piece of data, complete the following steps to complete its list:
1. From the provided treatment groups, add the group name of the group that is being observed in this datum or the group the most closely resembles it.
2. Add the name of the biomarker observed.
3. Determine which type the observation is out of three options: numerical, frequency, and descriptive (output your choice as written here). Numerical is a discrete summary statistic, usually a mean and SD. Frequency is data describing how common a condition is within the treatment group population, usually a percentage or count. Descriptive data contains no numbers and simple states an observation of the treatment group specifically inferring a toxicity caused by a treatment.
4. Add the value of the data, omitting any units. If it is a mean +- SD, only include the mean, and write the observation verbatim if it is descriptive data. If the data is frequency and the sample size is included as well (ie. '4 out of the 10 mice'), write it in a fraction like so: count/sample_size (ie. 4/10). Remember that all numerical and frequency data should be numeric and description data should be text.
5. Add the observation value's units. If it is frequency data, choose out of the following: percentage, decimal, count. Percentage is a value between 0 and 100, decimal is a value between 0 and 1, and count is the number of subjects in the group with the condition. If the data is descriptive, put N/A here.
6. If the data is numerical, put the SD here. If there is no SD or if the data is frequency or descriptive, put N/A here.
The end format looks like this:
group|biomarker|type|value|units|SD
Do not include any other text or whitespace besides your answer. If a piece of information requested is not available in the paragraph, put N/A in its respective spot.
# Methods
Methods
Zebrafish Husbandry
Zebrafish (AB strain Danio rerio) which were born and raised in our laboratory were kept at approximately 28.5 C on a 10-hour dark and a 14-hour light cycle. Mature zebrafish (AB strain Danio rerio) were bred and eggs were collected the morning after fertilization. All viable eggs were selected and raised in an incubator set to 28 C. At 6 days post fertilization (dpf), the larval zerbrafish were moved to a water filtration system with the mature zebrafish. As larvae, they were fed brine shrimp and as they matured flake fish food (Tetra Fish Food, Blacksburg, VA, USA) was added. The mature zebrafish were housed in 3-L tanks in an Aquatic Habitats (Apopka, FL, USA) flow through housing system. Each tank held fish from the same experimental or control group. Tanks were placed on a 6-tier dual filtration and constantly aerated rack unit. The tank water was made from deionized H2O, sodium bicarbonate, and sea salts (Instant Ocean, 1.2 g/20 L of water). All the experiments were performed during the light phase between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Fish from all of the treatment groups were tested throughout this period so that time of day effects would not be confounded with treatment. The procedures in these studies were approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol number A006-13-01) in accordance with United States Federal regulations.
Dosing Paradigm
For the acute dosing adult study, we separated mature zebrafish eighth months of age, into three experimental groups and a control group (N=11-12 per group). Each experimental group was immersed in groups in a low, medium, or high dose of methylphenidate (2-mg/L, 4-mg/L, or 8-mg/L) for 30 min prior to behavioral testing. Methylphenidate was added to water taken from the tank housing system at the same pH and poured into a dosing beaker. A control group was immersed in water from the housing system for 30 min prior to behavioral testing.
For the sub-chronic developmental dosing study, we separated the zebrafish into three age groups (N = 20 per group). The first age group began dosing at 14-dpf, the second age group at 21-dpf, and the third age group at 28-dpf. We dosed the fish in groups housed in still water tanks by dissolving 0-mg/L, 2-mg/L or 4-mg/L of methylphenidate in their water for two days, rinsed them, and then put the fish back in the flow-through housing system. They were dosed for two days twice a week. After dosing, the fish were kept in still water tanks without methylphenidate. There were control groups that underwent the same procedures without methylphenidate exposure for each age group. The developing zebrafish were dosed twice a week from their respective start points until they were twelve weeks of age. All behavioral testing took place shortly following the twelfth week post fertilization when the zebrafish were no longer given methylphenidate.
Novel Tank Dive Test
The novel tank diving task is a paradigm that indexes the diving response of zebrafish when placed in a new environment. In this task, a single fish is placed in a 5-L plastic tanks filled with 1350 ml of tank water for five min. The trapezoid shaped tanks were 22.9 cm along the bottom and 27.9 cm along the top. The diagonal side of the tank was 15.9 cm and the opposite vertical side was 15.2 cm, the same design as used previously. During a five-min trial in a novel tank, the fish's distance from the bottom of the tank and total distance traveled was tracked using EthoVision  program (Noldus Information and Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands). After the trial, the video - recorded by a Samsung Camcorder - was analyzed. The mean distance from the bottom of the tank (cm) was calculated as well as the total distance traveled (cm). The total distance (cm) traveled each min was converted to a swimming speed (cm traveled/min). Previous studies have shown that zebrafish tend to dwell near the bottom of a novel environment presumably as a predator avoidance strategy in a novel environment. As time passes without threat the fish swim through the entire water column in an apparent foraging pattern.
Predator Avoidance Test
After dosing, the fish were placed individually into the predator avoidance paradigm, which measured the response of the zebrafish to a perceived predator. In the predator avoidance paradigm, each individual fish was placed into a tank with a monitor at one end for five min. The first min allowed the fish to acclimate to the environment. In the second min, the monitor displayed a blue dot that started small and grew larger within 5 s to mimic the sight of an oncoming predator getting closer. The screen was blank in the third min and then the stimulus was presented again in min four. The two dependent measures were speed of swimming (cm/min) and average position in the tank relative to the stimulus (cm from screen) for each minute. The distance from the monitor, speed and swimming pattern were tracked using EthoVision. For a detailed description of this test, please see. Our first dependent measure was the total distance traveled when the predator stimulus was on (min 2, 4) compared to when the predator stimulus was off (min 1, 3, 5). We also calculated a flee response defined as an increase in distance from the monitor when the perceived predator stimulus was presented (min 2, 4) compared to the control min of the trial preceding the stimulus presentation when the screen was blank (min 1, 3 respectively). Both the first and the second flee responses are reported as the change in location (cm). The flee response indexes whether learning and memory played a role in the second trial. Published data indicate that control fish swim away from the perceived predator stimulus during the first presentation of the stimulus and then less so during the second presentation as the fish habituate to the stimulus that despite appearances presents no threat. This measure also indicates that control fish are more likely to be closer to the screen when the predator is off compared to when the perceived predator is on.
Social Shoaling Test
The shoaling task measures the zebrafish's reaction to seeing a shoal following social isolation. An individual fish was isolated for 30 min and then placed into a tank with a monitor at one end for five min. The first min of the trial was a control min that allowed the fish acclimate to the environment. In the following five min, the monitor displayed a video of other zebrafish swimming in a shoal. The distance from the monitor, speed and swimming pattern are tracked using EthoVision. We measured the distance from the shoaling stimulus displayed on the screen by min. According to published data, normal behavior for control fish is to approach the shoal by swimming near the monitor. In other words, control fish are closer to the monitor on average when the video of the shoal is being shown in comparison the control image of moving dots. For a more detailed description of this test, please see Bailey et al..
Data Analysis
All the statistics were calculated using IBM SPSS Statistics Software Version 22 (Armonk, NY, USA) and SuperANOVA/Statview (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The alpha level for statistical tests was set at 0.05. The behavioral tests were analyzed using a repeated measure model where the time course of the trial was the repeated measure. In the predator avoidance paradigm, periods when the predator stimulus was on or off was a repeated measure. Tests for simple main effects, between subjects contrasts and within-subjects contrasts were run. Analysis of the linear and quadratic trends of movement and position over time was evaluated. These trends assess the linear increase or decrease of movement or position over time of the test (linear trend) and the change in linear progression over time (quadratic trend). For example, a constant increase in position or speed over time would be detected as a linear trend and an accelerating increase in position or speed over time would be detected as a quadratic trend.
In the acute dosing paradigm, all the groups were included in the analysis. In the sub-chronic dosing paradigm, the highest dose of methylphenidate was fatal to the youngest group of zebrafish and all of them died. The methylphenidate did not cause significantly greater mortality in any of the other age groups than the casualties that occurred in the matched control groups (N dead = 1-2 fish/group). Thus, the highest dose 4 mg/L is excluded from all further analysis across age groups. Outliers with averages that were more two standard deviations from the mean were re-tracked to ensure that there were not errors in their video quality. If the video was faulty, the trials were eliminated from further analysis. However, if their videos were accurate, their values were included in subsequent analysis. The number of zebrafish per age and treatment group was N = 11-16 per group for the acute study and N = 20 per group in the chronic study.

# Paragraph
{'title': 'Sub-Chronic Methylphenidate Exposure - Social Shoaling Test', 'text': 'There was an interaction between age and methylphenidate dose (F(1,59) = 2.81, p < 0.10). The younger (14 day) zebrafish showed a significant (p<0.05) reduction in activity with 2-mg/L of methylphenidate compared to controls (Control = 309.3 +- 53.0, 2-mg/L methylphenidate = 210.0 +- 23.4), while the older zebrafish (21 day) dosed with 2-mg/L of methylphenidate did not exhibit much change in their locomotor activity (Control = 263.5 +- 20.0, 2-mg/L methylphenidate = 261.5 +- 27.2). There were no significant differences between groups or main effects when measuring the distance to the screen that displayed the shoal.', 'label': True}
