# Instructions
You will be given the methods section of an animal toxicity paper, a list of groups derived from the text, and a paragraph containing animal toxicity data. Your goal is to extract each piece of data from the text in a standardized manner. Each piece of data should specify a treatment group, be the results of specifically an in vivo animal toxicity study, and be describing a summary statistic (ie. mean +- SD, 'hepatotoxicity seen in 12/20 of group') or observation of a toxicity biomarker (ie. 'significantly higher levels of lesions in treatment group'). Your answer should be a list dilineated by '|' for each piece of data, each on a new line. For each piece of data, complete the following steps to complete its list:
1. From the provided treatment groups, add the group name of the group that is being observed in this datum or the group the most closely resembles it.
2. Add the name of the biomarker observed.
3. Determine which type the observation is out of three options: numerical, frequency, and descriptive (output your choice as written here). Numerical is a discrete summary statistic, usually a mean and SD. Frequency is data describing how common a condition is within the treatment group population, usually a percentage or count. Descriptive data contains no numbers and simple states an observation of the treatment group specifically inferring a toxicity caused by a treatment.
4. Add the value of the data, omitting any units. If it is a mean +- SD, only include the mean, and write the observation verbatim if it is descriptive data. If the data is frequency and the sample size is included as well (ie. '4 out of the 10 mice'), write it in a fraction like so: count/sample_size (ie. 4/10). Remember that all numerical and frequency data should be numeric and description data should be text.
5. Add the observation value's units. If it is frequency data, choose out of the following: percentage, decimal, count. Percentage is a value between 0 and 100, decimal is a value between 0 and 1, and count is the number of subjects in the group with the condition. If the data is descriptive, put N/A here.
6. If the data is numerical, put the SD here. If there is no SD or if the data is frequency or descriptive, put N/A here.
The end format looks like this:
group|biomarker|type|value|units|SD
Do not include any other text or whitespace besides your answer. If a piece of information requested is not available in the paragraph, put N/A in its respective spot.

Ethics
All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the European Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and approved by the French Ministry of Nation Education, Higher Education, Research and Innovation after ethical assessment by the local ethics committee Comite d'Ethique en Experimentation Animale Val de Loire (CEEA VdL) and INRAE consented to use the animals in this experimental protocol (protocols registered under APAFIS numbers 13965-2018042008519239v2 and 14014-2018030717477406v2).
Experimental design
A total of 40 primiparous Ile-de-France ewes (average age 2.5 years) were housed in a sheepfold from 2018 to 2019. The experimental design was described previously. Briefly, the ewes were divided into two groups with contrasting diets: restricted (R, n = 20) and well-fed (WF, n = 20). The diet was designed according to the INRAE recommendations for the growth and maintenance needs of adult, non-pregnant ewes. It consisted in varying the quantity of a wheat-based food supplement (Agneau-echange, AXEREAL Elevage, Saint Germain de Salles, France). The food supplement was distributed in the morning and the animals had free access to straw and water and minerals to lick. Ewes from the experiment groups were fed in order to reach the goal of a median BCS of 2 in restricted groups and of 4 in well-fed groups and the quantity was adjusted according to the mean of body weight of the group. Ewes in the restricted group were initially fed 50% of their maintenance energy requirements and, once the target BCS was reached, they were fed 80% in order to maintain the desired nutritional status. Ewes in the WF groups were fed 165% of their maintenance energy requirements until the end of the experiment. The BW (kg) and BCS (on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 corresponding to very skinny ewes and 5 to obese ewes) of animals were monitored once a month. Within each group, two subgroups were defined according to BPS exposure (0-50 microg/kg/day) for at least 3 month, 5.4 +- 0.1 months (range: 3.6-7.9 months. The BPS, purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Madrid, Spain), was added to the feed in the form of a powder mixed with the cereals. Thus, there were four groups: R0 and R50 for the restricted ewes, and WF0 and WF50 for the well-fed ewes. Between September and December, the oestrus cycle of the 40 ewes was synchronised with a vaginal sponge of progesterone (Chrono-Gest  20 mg, MSD, Beaucouze, France) for 11 days, followed by intramuscular administration of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG, Synchro-Part  PMSG 400 IU, CEVA Sante Animale, Libourne, France). Two days after PMSG administration, at the presumed time of the pre-ovulatory period, the ewes were slaughtered, and follicular cells of the dominant follicles were collected by aspirating the follicular fluid containing GCs. GCs were centrifuged and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then stored dry at -80  C until analyses. Blood samples (5 mL) were collected at the time of slaughterhouse bleeding in heparinised tubes (17 IU/mL sodium heparin, Vacutainer ; Becton Dickinson and Company, Le Pont de Claix, France), centrifuged (3,700 g for 30 min at 4  C) and plasma samples were stored at -20  C for further assay of glucose, NEFA, BPS and its metabolite BPS-glucuronide (BPS-g).
Plasma glucose, non-esterified fatty-acids BPS and BPS-glucuronide assays
Plasma glucose and NEFA were quantified individually (n = 80) on a 2 and 5 microL undiluted plasma sample, respectively, by colorimetric enzymatic methods using a Konelab 20 analyzer (Thermo Scientific, Gometz le Chatel, France) and kits provided by Bio-Merieux (Marcy-l'Etoile, France) and Thermo Scientific (Villebon sur Yvette, France). BPS and BPS-g concentration were quantified as previously describe using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry with an Acquity U-HPLC device coupled to a Xevo-TQ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters, SaintQuentin-en-Yvelines, France) operated with positive electrospray ionization and MRM mode. All samples were quantified on the same day. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was set at 0.5 ng/mL (2 nM) for BPS and 0.05 ng/mL (0.10 nM) for BPS-g.
Protein extraction and quantification
The GC pellet was resuspended on ice with 100 microL of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl + 2% sodium dodecyl sulphate [SDS] + 1X protease inhibitor). Then, it was sonicated (2 x 20 s, five times for each sample) and centrifuged (30 min, 10000 g, 4  C). The supernatant was transferred to a new tube kept on ice and stored at -20  C. The protein concentration was quantified using the colorimetric BC assay Protein Quantification kit (Interchim, Montlucon, France), following the manufacturer's recommendations. The optical density at 550 nm was measured with a Thermo LabSystems plate reader at 550 nm absorbance and with Ascent software for Multiskan equipment.
Preparation of GC samples for comparative proteomic analyses
After protein extraction and quantification, 50 microg of protein per sample was separated with 4-10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (80 V, 10 min and 180 V, 50 min). After separation, the gel was stained with Coomassie blue. It was cut into four strips for each track and washed in water and acetonitrile (1:1 [v/v], 5 min) followed by 100% acetonitrile (10 min). Reduction and cysteine alkylation were performed by successive incubation with 10 mM dithiothreitol in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (30 min, 56  C), then 55 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (20 min, room temperature, in the dark). The pieces were incubated with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate with acetonitrile (1:1 [v/v], 10 min) followed by acetonitrile (15 min). Proteolytic digestion was carried out overnight using 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate containing 12.5 ng/microL trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Diagnostics, Paris, France). The resultant peptides were extracted by incubation in 5% formic acid (with sonication). The supernatant was removed and incubated with acetonitrile and 1% formic acid (1:1 [v/v], 10 min). After a final incubation with acetonitrile (5 min), the supernatant was removed and saved. These two peptide extractions were pooled and dried using a SPD1010 SpeedVac system (Thermosavant, Thermofisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).
NanoLC-MS/MS
Peptide mixtures were analysed with on-line nanoLC-MS/MS as described previously. All experiments were performed on a dual linear ion trap Fourier-transform mass spectrometer (FT-MS) LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled to an Ultimate  3000 RSLC Ultra High-Pressure Liquid Chromatographer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) controlled by Chromeleon Software (version 6.80 SR13). The samples were desalted and concentrated for 10 min at 5 microL/min on an LCPackings trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100 C18, 75 mum inner diameter x 2 cm long, 3 mum particles, 100 A pores). The peptide separation was conducted using a LCPackings nano-column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 75 mum inner diameter x 50 cm long, 2 mum particles, 100 A pores) at 300 nL/min by applying a gradient of 2-45% B over 90 min. The mobile phases consisted of 0.1% formic acid, 97.9% water and 2% acetonitrile (v/v/v; A), and 0.1% formic acid, 19.9% water, 80% acetonitrile (v/v/v; B). The data were acquired using Xcalibur version 3.0.63 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA), in positive data-dependent mode in the 300-1800 m/z mass range. The resolution in the Orbitrap was set at R = 60,000. The 20 most intense peptide ions with charge states >= 2 were isolated sequentially (isolation width 2 m/z, 1 microscan) and fragmented in the high-pressure linear ion trap using the collision induced dissociation (CID) mode (collision energy 35%, activation time 10 ms, Qz 0.25). Dynamic exclusion was activated for 30 s with a repeat count of 1. The lock mass was enabled for accurate mass measurements. The polydimethylcyclosiloxane ((Si(CH3)2O)6, m/z 445.120025) ion was used for internal recalibration of the mass spectra MS/MS.
Protein identification and data validation
Ion searches were performed using the Mascot search engine version 2.7.0.1 (Matrix Science, London, UK) via the Proteome Discoverer 2.5 software (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) against the NCBI prot_Mammals database (2021/07). The search parameters included trypsin as the protease with two allowed missed cleavages and carbamidomethyl cysteine, methionine oxidation and acetylation of the N-terminal protein as variable modifications. The tolerance of the ions was set to 5 ppm for parent and 0.8 Da for-fragment ion matches. The Mascot results obtained from the target and decoy databases searches were analysed with the Scaffold Q + S v5.1.1 and Scaffold Quant v5.0.3 softwares (Proteome Software, Portland, OR, USA) using the protein cluster analysis option (assemblage of proteins into clusters based on shared peptide evidence). Peptide and protein identifications were accepted if they could be established with a probability of > 95%, in accordance with the Peptide Prophet and the Protein Prophet algorithms, respectively. Proteins were identified with a minimum of two unique peptides. Extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) is based on the normalised values of the intensities of the chromatographic peaks corresponding to the peptides of a protein. XIC data were log transformed (log10 precursor intensity). The names of clusters, redundant proteins, and potential contaminants (keratin from Homo sapiens and trypsin) were excluded from the lists. In addition, only Homo sapiens and the followed herbivorous species were retained: Ovis aries, Ammotragus lervia, Bison bison bison, Bos indicus, Bos indicus x Bos taurus, Bos javanicus, Bos mutus, Bos taurus, Bubalus bubalis, Camelus bactrianus, Camelus dromedarius, Camelus ferus, Capra hircus, Cervus elaphus, Cervus elaphus hippelaphus, Cervus hangul yarkandensis, Equus asinus, Equus caballus, Equus przewalskii, Muntiacus muntjac, Muntiacus reevesi, Muntiacus vaginalis, Odocoileus virginianus texanus, Odocoileus virginianus virginianus, Ovis canadensis nelson, and Vicugna pacos.
Drawing up a list of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs)
Regarding the proteins detected in all conditions, DAPs were identified after analysis of variance (ANOVA) on protein abundance (p <= 0.05) and t-test (p <= 0.05), when the fold-change (FC) between the two conditions was >= 2 or <= 0.5. Regarding the proteins present in one condition but not in the other, DAPs were identified after the chi-square test on the protein detection rate (p <= 0.05). Briefly, proteins were considered to be present in a biological sample when they were detected at least once in one of the three technical replicates. Proteins that were not detected in any biological replicate for a condition were tested using the chi-square test for the bisphenol effect (proteins quantified for exposed and unexposed animals regardless of diet) and the effect of diet (proteins quantified for restricted and well-fed animals regardless of BPS exposure), but also for pairwise analyses (R0 vs. R50, WF0 vs. WF50, R0 vs. WF0, and R50 vs. WF50). This yielded 17 proteins with a p <= 0.05 (chi-square test) for at least one of the comparisons (dose, diet or pairwise) and an average abundance (log10 precursor intensity) ranging from 5.94 to 7.58. For pairwise analyses, proteins with significant differences in the detection rate according to bisphenol exposure were added to the lists of DAPs for the R0 vs. R50 and WF0 vs. WF50 comparisons; likewise, proteins exhibiting significant differences in the detection rate according to diet effect were added to the lists of DAPs for the R0 vs. WF0 and R50 vs. WF50 comparisons. Proteins that responded only to the pairwise analysis (R0 vs. R50, WF0 vs. WF50, R0 vs. WF0, or R50 vs. WF50) were added to the corresponding DAPs lists.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed and a heatmap was generated by using the Rstudio software (version 2023.03.0 + 386). PCA on DAPs (both ANOVA and the chi-square test) were carried out using the FactoMineR and ggplot2 packages. The percentage on each axis (dimension) represents the total variance of data according to dimension 1 (horizontal axis) and dimension 2 (vertical axis). Heatmap and hierarchical clustering on DAPs (both ANOVA and chi-square test p < 0.05) were performed using the gplots package. For DAPs from the ANOVA, missing values (in one replicate among detected values in other replicates of the condition) were treated with the missMDA package. For DAPs from the chi-square test, missing values (in all replicates of a condition) were deliberately replaced by '1' because the XIC data were log-transformed (log10 precursor intensity), indicating the absence of detection.
Functional analysis and prediction of biological processes of DAPs
The overlaps of DAPs between the different conditions was visualised using the online tool jvenn (https://jvenn.toulouse.inrae.fr/app/example.html). Gene enrichment analysis was performed separately for each pairwise comparison. Because the O. aries genome contains less information than the H. sapiens genome, the latter was used as preferential database for functional analyses. Gene lists of DAPs were used as input into the Database for Annotation, Visualisation and Integrated Discovery (DAVID version 2021) for Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. GO terms associated with over-represented biological processes (p < 0.05) were considered significant. The Metascape Enrichment analysis tool was used to study the potential roles of DAPs (https://metascape.org/). The Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways associated with 958 quantified proteins and DAPs from the pairwise comparisons were investigated using the Proteomaps software (http://bionic-vis.biologie.uni-greifswald.de/). For each comparison, proteomaps were created from the highest log10 precursor intensity values of the overabundant DAPs in each pairwise comparison with a minimum FC >= 2 or <= 0.5. For the proteins quantified, proteomaps were generated by using the highest value from the four groups (R0, R50, WF0 and WF50).

# Paragraph
{'title': 'Pairwise comparisons of proteins in GCs from ewes exposed or not exposed to BPS and presenting contrasted metabolic status', 'text': "To decipher the impact of BPS, proteomaps of the DAPs for the R0 vs. R50 and WF0 vs. WF50 comparisons were generated by using the KEGG pathways database (Fig. 6A and B). One of the common functions between both comparisons is carbohydrate metabolism, including the beta-glucuronidase (GUSB), which is present in both proteomaps. This protein was detected in all BPS-exposed ewes (the R50 and WF50 conditions), whereas it was not quantified in the R0 samples and was detected in 50% of the WF0 samples (Supplementary Table S3). Another common protein, nucleoprotein translocated promoter region (TPR) - which is involved in the processing of genetic information, more specifically in RNA transport - is also found in both proteomaps (Fig. 6A and B). This protein was more detected in R50 and WF50 (75% detection rate) compared with R0 (25% detection rate) and WF0 (0% detection rate; Supplementary Table S3). The diet effect, visualised as R0 vs. WF0 and R50 vs. WF50, showed proteins that are mainly involved in lipid and glycan metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and purine and amino acid metabolism, including proteins like thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST), farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1) and bis(5'-adenosyl)-triphosphatase (FHIT). Both TST and FDFT1 were detected more frequently in restricted than well-fed ewes (Fig. 6C and D). TST was detected in 75% and 100% of R0 and R50 samples, respectively, whereas it was detected in 25% and 0% of WF0 and WF50 samples, respectively. Similarly, FDFT1 was detected in 75% and 100% of R0 and R50 samples, respectively, whereas it was detected in 0% and 50% of WF0 and WF50, respectively. On the contrary, FHIT was detected in 0% and 50% of R0 and R50 samples, respectively, whereas it was detected in 75% and 100% of WF0 and WF50, respectively, and was therefore found more often in well-fed ewes than in restricted ewes. Interestingly, proteins involved in oxidative stress were found in the R0 vs. R50 proteomaps, namely glutathione peroxidase 7 (GPX7), and in the R0 vs. WF0 proteomaps, namely NADH dehydrogenase 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 7 (NDUFA7). GPX7 was more abundant in R50 compared with R0 (FC = 15.6) and NDUFA7 was more abundant in WF0 compared with R0 (FC = 5.6; Supplementary Table S2). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP), a protein involved in the NF-kappa B signalling pathway; nicastrin (NCSTN), a protein involved in the Notch signalling pathway; and apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), a protein involved in the PPAR signalling pathway, were also found in the WF0 vs. WF50 and R50 vs. WF50 proteomaps. LBP was less abundant in WF0 compared with WF50 (FC = 0.34), and less abundant in R50 compared with WF50 (FC = 0.06). NCSTN was detected more frequently in WF0 (75%) compared with WF50 (undetected), and more frequently detected in R50 (75%) compared with WF50 (undetected). APOA1 was more abundant in WF50 compared with WF0 (FC = 2.35) and R50 (FC = 2.48). Lastly, ras-related protein Rab-5B (RAB5B) and ras-related protein Rab-5 C (RAB5C), involved in protein transport, were found in the R0 vs. R50 and R0 vs. WF0 proteomaps. They were more abundant in R50 (FC = 2.45 and 3.10, respectively) and WF0 (FC = 3.23 and 3.84, respectively) compared with R0.", 'label': True}
