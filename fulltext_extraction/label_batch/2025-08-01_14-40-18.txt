# Methods
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Wistar strain male albino rats (200-220 g) were maintained under standard laboratory conditions with water and food. For the folate-deficient group, folate-deficient diet was provided for 45 days prior to the experiment and methotrexate (MTX) was administered for a week before the experiment. The animals were handled according to the principles of laboratory care framed by the committee for the purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), Government of India. Prior to the experimentation, proper approval was obtained from the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (No: 01/032/2010/Aug-11).
2.2. Chemicals
Aspartame and Methotrexate were purchased from Sigma chemical company, St. Louis, MO, USA. Nitric oxide assay kit was purchased from Biovision, USA. Taq-Polymerase, DNTPs from Genet Bio, China, Reverse Transcriptase enzyme kit from Thermo scientific, USA, primary antibody was purchased from Sigma and Cell signalling, USA, secondary antibody was purchased from Merck and other molecular grade chemicals were from Merck Bangalore, India. All other chemicals were of analytical grade obtained from the Sisco research laboratory, Bombay, India.
2.3. Experimental design
The European Food Safety Authority recently confirmed its daily acceptable intake (ADI) for aspartame as 40 mg/kg b.wt./day. In order to confine within the human permitted exposure limit, this dose was selected. Aspartame (Sigma Aldrich, USA) was administered orally; (40 mg/kg b.wt) mixed 1:1 with 0.9% saline and this dosage based on the food and drug administration (FDA) approved ADI limit.
2.4. Groups
The rats were randomly divided into three groups, namely, saline control, folate deficient (MTX treated) control, and MTX-treated (folate deficient) + aspartame administered groups. Each group consisted of six animals. Methotrexate (MTX) in sterile saline was administered (0.2 mg/kg/day) subcutaneously for 7 days to folate-deficient groups. After 7 days of administration with MTX, folate deficiency was confirmed by estimating the urinary excretion of for-maminoglutamic acid (FIGLU). From the eighth day, the MTX-treated (folate deficient) (third) groups were administered orally with aspartame for 90 days, whereas the saline control or vehicle control and (folate deficient) MTX treated control groups received equivalent volumes of saline as an oral dose and all animals were handled similarly.
2.5. Brain collection and dissection
The animals were sacrificed using higher dose of long acting pentothal sodium (100 mg/kg.b.wt). Collection of the blood samples and isolation of brain was performed between 8 and 10 a.m. to avoid circadian rhythm-induced changes. The brain was immediately removed and washed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Further dissection was made on ice cold glass plate. The discrete regions of the brain (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, midbrain, Pons medulla, hippocampus and hypothalamus) were dissected according the method given in our previous publication. The homogenate (10% w/v) of the individual regions was prepared in a Teflon-glass tissue homogenizer, using ice-cold PBS (100 mM, pH 7.4) buffer and centrifuged separately in refrigerated centrifuge 4  C at 3000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was used for analyzing the biochemical estimations in this study. The body weight was recorded every week to monitor the influence of the aspartame treatment period.
2.6. Estimation of plasma corticosterone and LD50 of aspartame by Karber's method
Plasma corticosterone was estimated by the method given by Clark. The method is based on the oxidation of corticosteroids with iron (III) in acidic medium and subsequent complex of iron (II) with potassium hexacynoferrate (III). The method offers the advantage of sensitivity and stability. The absorbance was measured at 780 nm in spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800). The level of corticosterone in the plasma was expressed as mumolar (muM). The calculation of LD50 by the method of Karber was used for the determination of LD50 of aspartame in Wistar albino rats. LD50 = LD100 -  (a x b)n. n = number of rats in a group. a = difference between two successive doses of aspartame administered. b = average number of dead animals in two successive aspartame doses. LD100 = Lethal dose causing the 100% death of all rats.
2.7. Estimation of membrane bound enzymes
The activity of Na+/K+ ATPase (ATP: Phosphohydrolase - EC. 3.6.1.3.) in the tissue was estimated by the method of Bernabe et al.. The activity of Ca2+-ATPase (ATP: Phosphohydrolase - EC. 3.6.1.3.) in the tissues was estimated as described by Hjerten and Pan and the activity of Mg2+-ATPase (ATP: Phosphohydrolase - EC. 3.6.1.3.) in the tissues was estimated by the methods of Ohnishi et al..
2.8. Estimation of acetylcholine esterase (AChE)
The activity of Acetylcholine esterase in the tissues was estimated by the method of Ellman et al.. The Principle of the method being the measurement of the rate of production of thiocholine as acetylthiocholine is hydrolysed. This is accomplished by the continuous reaction of the thiol with 5:5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoate iron (I) 5 to produce the yellow anion of 5-thio-2-nitro-benzoic acid (II). The rate of colour production is measured at 412 nm.
2.9. Determination of nitrite using nitric oxide assay kit
To investigate nitric oxide formation it is essential to measure nitrite (NO2) which is one of two primary stable and nonvolatile breakdown products of NO. This assay relies on a diazotization reaction that was originally described by Griess. The original reaction has been described as a Griess reagent system is based on the chemical reaction, which uses sulfanilamide and N-1-napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NED) under acidic (phosphoric acid) conditions.
2.10. Measurement of memory in Y maze and Morris water maze
The Y maze measures spatial working and recognition memory by making use of a rodent's natural exploratory instincts. In Y-maze the three arms were marked as A, B, C and "C" is marked as the novel arm (blocked arm) to test the spatial working memory. The first session measures spatial working memory in the rat by scoring the number of alternations the rat does in Y-maze when the animal visits all three arms without going into the same arm twice in a row. If working memory is intact, the rat should remember the first two arms and be more inquisitive about the third arm (originally blocked arm). In the second session open the blocked arm and the rats were left 5 min of time to evaluate the spatial recognition memory. A rat with a normal memory should spend more time exploring the "new" unblocked arm. The alternations for the first 2 min were calculated. The overall percentage for 5 min and the percentage for the first 2 min were also calculated for spatial working and recognition memory. The Morris water maze (MWM) test consists of a circular pool made of non-toxic white metal, filled with water and maintained at 21 +- 1  C. A platform was placed 1 cm below the water surface at a fixed position. Animals were acclimatized and trained. Animals were monitored using an automated tracking system (Ethovision software). Visible platform trials were performed to evaluate sensorimotor and/or motivational deficits that could influence performance during the learning task. Hidden-platform training consisted of 6 days with each day comprised four trials with a 60min interval. The platform location remained constant in the hidden platform trials, and the entry point was changed randomly in all days. Memory retention was assessed by a probe trial after the 6 days hidden-platform training. The time spent in the target quadrant without the platform was taken to measure level of memory retention in the probe trial.
2.11. Isolation of total RNA & reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol reagent following the method given in our previous publication. The total RNA obtained was free from protein and DNA contamination. The reverse transcription step was performed by using the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme kit. Each 20 muL reaction mixture contained 5 muL OligodT (10 muM), 1 muL dNTP (10 muM), 4 muL First Strand buffer (5x), 0.2 muL super script III reverse transcriptase (200 U/muL) varied quantity of RNA template (dependent on RNA concentration) and RNase free water to make up the volume. Thermal cycling conditions for the first strand reaction consisted of 25  C for 5 min, 50  C for 45 min, 70  C for 15 min and finally maintained at 4  C for 5 min. PCR amplification was performed using Taq DNA Polymerase. Each 20 muL of sample contained 10 muL Master mix (2 muM), 1 muL forward primer, 1 muL reverse primer (Table 3) for both gene of interest and internal control consecutively, 2 muL RT sample, 4 muL sterile water. The mixture was kept at thermocycler and amplified for 35 cycles. Each thermocycling consisted of 94  C for 30 s, varied annealing temperature for each gene of interest for 30 s, 72  C for 30 s. beta-actin was co amplified with c-fos, iNOS, nNOS, Hsp70 genes using the same procedures. The sense and antisense primer for the study is tabulated in table. Ten microliters of each PCR product was analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel. Agarose gel electrophoresis is an effective method for the identification of purified DNA molecules. Amplified product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining. Then the gel containing cDNA was visualized with the help of the fluorescent imager (Bio-Rad, USA). The Band intensity was quantified by Quantity One Software. The band intensification for each enzyme mRNA was normalized with that of the internal control beta-actin using Quantity One Software.
2.12. Histopathology
Animals were deeply anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride. Rats were then perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by buffered 10% formalin. The brain was removed, and preserved in formalin until processed for histology. Then kept on running water to remove formalin pigments and dehydrated with ascending grades of alcohol. After impregnation with paraffin wax, the paraffin blocks were made. They were processed and sections were cut with 10 nm in thickness using "Spencer Lens, rotatory microtome (No 820, New York, USA) and then stained with Cresyl fast violet as follows for the brain.
2.13. Immunohistochemical analysis
Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out using the DAB universal staining kit (Merck Genie, Bengaluru, India). The sections were deparaffinized in xylene and dehydrated in ethanol. After washing with PBS, slides were incubated with 3% H2O2 in at room temperature for 15 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. After antigen retrieval (15 min of autoclaving in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0), the slides were incubated with blocking solution (10% normal goat serum) for 5 min at room temperature. Then, the sections were incubated overnight with primary antibody. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) secondary link antibody for 30 min at room temperature, washed with PBS. Then, the sections were treated with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen for 15 min. Finally, the sections were washed with deionised water, counter stained with haematoxylin and mounted. Photographs were taken using Nikon microscope (Nikon 1.25X Japan DS-Fi1).
2.14. Western blot
The brains were washed with ice-cold PBS and powdered in liquid nitrogen, was suspended in the cytobuster buffer (Invitrogen) was used to detect the NMDAR, CaMKII, ERK, CREB, PSD95 and Synaptophysin. Protein concentrations of brain lysates were assayed using BCA reagent (BioRad, USA). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to 8% and 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels at 70 V, and were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Merck Millipore) at 300 mA for 90 min, and then blocked with 5% fat-free milk or BSA for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight with the primary antibodies at 4  C. Membranes were washed and probed with secondary antibody: goat anti-rat IgG, and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo-scientific). Protein signals were visualized using an ECL chemiluminescent HRP substrate detection system. The band intensity was quantified by ImageJ and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, USA). The membranes were stripped and reprobed for B-actin (Sigma) (1:10,000) as an internal control.
2.15. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS statistical package version 18.0. The results are expressed as Mean +- SD and the data were analyzed by the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Turkey's multiple comparison tests when there is a significant 'F' test ratio. The level of significance was fixed at p <= 0.05.

# Paragraphs
<paragraph1>
The present study support the fatal effect of aspartame when consumed repeatedly for a prolonged period and it may be probably due to the toxic metabolite methanol. It has been reported that following aspartame consumption, the concentrations of its metabolites are increased in the blood stream. A small amount of aspartame significantly increases the plasma methanol level. Further, it was reported that not only the metabolites of methanol, but methanol per se as well, is toxic to the brain. In addition, this increase in the blood methanol level was associated with a marked increase in the free radical generation in brain regions of aspartame treated animals. The cells can be injured or killed when the ROS generation overwhelms the cellular antioxidant capacity indicate its vulnerability to free radicals. In this study the LD50 of aspartame was analyzed by karber's method, the LD50 of aspartame (Table 2) in rats is 10.95 g/kg of body weight. Aspartame interfered in the body weight of the treated animals (Fig. 1B) when compared to the control rats throughout the study duration.
</paragraph1>
<paragraph2>
The nitric oxide ( NO), a nitrogen free radical, is produced by a number of different cell types. The elevation of nitric oxide (Fig. 1C) observed in this study again support the generation of free radical by aspartame. However, this increase in nitric oxide after aspartame consumption could not be overlooked because according to McCord, the prolonged exposure to free radicals, even at a low concentration, may result in the damage of biologically important molecules. In this finding the aspartame treated animals, did showed an elevation of nitric oxide level but not the nitrite and this is supported by the western blot study in which nNOS protein expression was enhanced along with increase mRNA expression of nitric oxide synthesizing enzyme nNOS and iNOS (Figs. 3 and 4). Studies demonstrated that NO produced by iNOS causes damage to brain cells, a process which has been demonstrated in many neurodegenerative diseases and exert numerous toxic effects in a wide variety of mammalian cell targets.
</paragraph2>
<paragraph3>
In the present study, there was an increased plasma corticosterone level (Fig. 1A) in the aspartame treated animals and it is relevant to point out that, in our earlier report also there was a marked increase in the corticosterone level in the plasma on (75 mg/kg) aspartame administered rats, indicating that the dietary sweetener aspartame could act as a chemical stressor. Decrease in membrane bound ATPases activity (Table 1) in this study may be due to free radical generation and high NO level, which is supported by few studies. Ashok et al. reported that methanol induced increased production of free radicals and increased oxidative damage to distinct brain regions, retina and optic nerve has also been reported. McIntosh et al. reported a decreased activity of the antioxidant enzymes in the brain of rats treated with glucocorticoids. Indicating that elevated free radical generation overwhelming the antioxidant defence system. High levels of NO have been associated with membrane lipid peroxidation which suggest that the aspartame mediated increase in free radical may be the cause behind the altered membrane integrity observed in this study which eventually lead to decrease in membrane bound ATPases activity.
</paragraph3>
<paragraph4>
Na+/K+-ATPase, the enzyme that maintains Na+ and K+ gradients across the plasma membrane, was reported to be inhibited by ROS in the brain which strengthen our argument. According to Polizzi et al., the Na+/K+ ATPase is very sensitive to the plasma membrane structure changes and therefore measuring its activity represents a valuable indicator of the early and late stages of tissue injury. Further, the decrease in the activity of these membrane bound enzymes could not be ignored as Na+/K+-ATPase is responsible for the generation of the membrane potential through the active transport of sodium and potassium ions in the neurons in CNS necessary and to maintain neuronal excitability. Moreover, the role of Mg2+-ATPase is to maintain high brain intracellular Mg2+ which can control rates of protein synthesis and cell growth. Na+/K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ ATPase in the plasma membrane also keeps the intracellular sodium low but intracellular magnesium and potassium high when compared with the levels in extracellular fluids. Hence, the increase in nitric oxide, free radical and corticosteroids in this study after aspartame consumption may be a contributing factor for the alteration observed in the membrane bound enzymes and finally altering the neuronal integrity.
</paragraph4>
<paragraph5>
The Y-maze task as used in the present study, with one novel arm throughout the experiment, is so-called "reference memory task." This type of test is considered to be hippocampus dependent. Various reports have shown that bilateral cytotoxic lesions of the hippocampal formation result in severe impairments in the Y-maze reference memory task and NO also contributes to hippocampal dependent learning and memory tasks including spatial memory. AChE is a key enzyme of the muscarinic cholinergic system, involved in learning and memory. However, NO formed as a result of iNOS up regulation during hypoxia has been found to interrupt the memory process by inhibiting acetylcholinergic activity. A marked decrease in the AChE activity (Fig. 1D) in the aspartame treated animals of present study lends a support to alteration in the learning and memory process (Fig. 2A-E) of these aspartame fed animals in both Morris water maze and Y maze task. It is also in agreement with the Irene et al., who reported that aspartame metabolites inhibit the activity of hippocampal AChE. Rico et al., reported that methanol exposure remarkably decreased zebrafish brain AChE activity, suggesting a neurodegenerative event promoted possibly by methanol and suggest that aspartame induced alterations may be mediated by methanol by affecting the hippocampus functioning. Moreover our previous study in 75 mg/kg aspartame consumption also showed alteration in the locomotor, anxiety and emotional behaviour of the treated rats. Thus supporting our study that aspartame attenuates learning, memory (Fig. 2A-E) and declines the memory retention in the Morris water maze task.
