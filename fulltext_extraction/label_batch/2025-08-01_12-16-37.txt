# Methods
Methods
Zebrafish Husbandry
Zebrafish (AB strain Danio rerio) which were born and raised in our laboratory were kept at approximately 28.5 C on a 10-hour dark and a 14-hour light cycle. Mature zebrafish (AB strain Danio rerio) were bred and eggs were collected the morning after fertilization. All viable eggs were selected and raised in an incubator set to 28 C. At 6 days post fertilization (dpf), the larval zerbrafish were moved to a water filtration system with the mature zebrafish. As larvae, they were fed brine shrimp and as they matured flake fish food (Tetra Fish Food, Blacksburg, VA, USA) was added. The mature zebrafish were housed in 3-L tanks in an Aquatic Habitats (Apopka, FL, USA) flow through housing system. Each tank held fish from the same experimental or control group. Tanks were placed on a 6-tier dual filtration and constantly aerated rack unit. The tank water was made from deionized H2O, sodium bicarbonate, and sea salts (Instant Ocean, 1.2 g/20 L of water). All the experiments were performed during the light phase between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Fish from all of the treatment groups were tested throughout this period so that time of day effects would not be confounded with treatment. The procedures in these studies were approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol number A006-13-01) in accordance with United States Federal regulations.
Dosing Paradigm
For the acute dosing adult study, we separated mature zebrafish eighth months of age, into three experimental groups and a control group (N=11-12 per group). Each experimental group was immersed in groups in a low, medium, or high dose of methylphenidate (2-mg/L, 4-mg/L, or 8-mg/L) for 30 min prior to behavioral testing. Methylphenidate was added to water taken from the tank housing system at the same pH and poured into a dosing beaker. A control group was immersed in water from the housing system for 30 min prior to behavioral testing.
For the sub-chronic developmental dosing study, we separated the zebrafish into three age groups (N = 20 per group). The first age group began dosing at 14-dpf, the second age group at 21-dpf, and the third age group at 28-dpf. We dosed the fish in groups housed in still water tanks by dissolving 0-mg/L, 2-mg/L or 4-mg/L of methylphenidate in their water for two days, rinsed them, and then put the fish back in the flow-through housing system. They were dosed for two days twice a week. After dosing, the fish were kept in still water tanks without methylphenidate. There were control groups that underwent the same procedures without methylphenidate exposure for each age group. The developing zebrafish were dosed twice a week from their respective start points until they were twelve weeks of age. All behavioral testing took place shortly following the twelfth week post fertilization when the zebrafish were no longer given methylphenidate.
Novel Tank Dive Test
The novel tank diving task is a paradigm that indexes the diving response of zebrafish when placed in a new environment. In this task, a single fish is placed in a 5-L plastic tanks filled with 1350 ml of tank water for five min. The trapezoid shaped tanks were 22.9 cm along the bottom and 27.9 cm along the top. The diagonal side of the tank was 15.9 cm and the opposite vertical side was 15.2 cm, the same design as used previously. During a five-min trial in a novel tank, the fish's distance from the bottom of the tank and total distance traveled was tracked using EthoVision  program (Noldus Information and Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands). After the trial, the video - recorded by a Samsung Camcorder - was analyzed. The mean distance from the bottom of the tank (cm) was calculated as well as the total distance traveled (cm). The total distance (cm) traveled each min was converted to a swimming speed (cm traveled/min). Previous studies have shown that zebrafish tend to dwell near the bottom of a novel environment presumably as a predator avoidance strategy in a novel environment. As time passes without threat the fish swim through the entire water column in an apparent foraging pattern.
Predator Avoidance Test
After dosing, the fish were placed individually into the predator avoidance paradigm, which measured the response of the zebrafish to a perceived predator. In the predator avoidance paradigm, each individual fish was placed into a tank with a monitor at one end for five min. The first min allowed the fish to acclimate to the environment. In the second min, the monitor displayed a blue dot that started small and grew larger within 5 s to mimic the sight of an oncoming predator getting closer. The screen was blank in the third min and then the stimulus was presented again in min four. The two dependent measures were speed of swimming (cm/min) and average position in the tank relative to the stimulus (cm from screen) for each minute. The distance from the monitor, speed and swimming pattern were tracked using EthoVision. For a detailed description of this test, please see. Our first dependent measure was the total distance traveled when the predator stimulus was on (min 2, 4) compared to when the predator stimulus was off (min 1, 3, 5). We also calculated a flee response defined as an increase in distance from the monitor when the perceived predator stimulus was presented (min 2, 4) compared to the control min of the trial preceding the stimulus presentation when the screen was blank (min 1, 3 respectively). Both the first and the second flee responses are reported as the change in location (cm). The flee response indexes whether learning and memory played a role in the second trial. Published data indicate that control fish swim away from the perceived predator stimulus during the first presentation of the stimulus and then less so during the second presentation as the fish habituate to the stimulus that despite appearances presents no threat. This measure also indicates that control fish are more likely to be closer to the screen when the predator is off compared to when the perceived predator is on.
Social Shoaling Test
The shoaling task measures the zebrafish's reaction to seeing a shoal following social isolation. An individual fish was isolated for 30 min and then placed into a tank with a monitor at one end for five min. The first min of the trial was a control min that allowed the fish acclimate to the environment. In the following five min, the monitor displayed a video of other zebrafish swimming in a shoal. The distance from the monitor, speed and swimming pattern are tracked using EthoVision. We measured the distance from the shoaling stimulus displayed on the screen by min. According to published data, normal behavior for control fish is to approach the shoal by swimming near the monitor. In other words, control fish are closer to the monitor on average when the video of the shoal is being shown in comparison the control image of moving dots. For a more detailed description of this test, please see Bailey et al..
Data Analysis
All the statistics were calculated using IBM SPSS Statistics Software Version 22 (Armonk, NY, USA) and SuperANOVA/Statview (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The alpha level for statistical tests was set at 0.05. The behavioral tests were analyzed using a repeated measure model where the time course of the trial was the repeated measure. In the predator avoidance paradigm, periods when the predator stimulus was on or off was a repeated measure. Tests for simple main effects, between subjects contrasts and within-subjects contrasts were run. Analysis of the linear and quadratic trends of movement and position over time was evaluated. These trends assess the linear increase or decrease of movement or position over time of the test (linear trend) and the change in linear progression over time (quadratic trend). For example, a constant increase in position or speed over time would be detected as a linear trend and an accelerating increase in position or speed over time would be detected as a quadratic trend.
In the acute dosing paradigm, all the groups were included in the analysis. In the sub-chronic dosing paradigm, the highest dose of methylphenidate was fatal to the youngest group of zebrafish and all of them died. The methylphenidate did not cause significantly greater mortality in any of the other age groups than the casualties that occurred in the matched control groups (N dead = 1-2 fish/group). Thus, the highest dose 4 mg/L is excluded from all further analysis across age groups. Outliers with averages that were more two standard deviations from the mean were re-tracked to ensure that there were not errors in their video quality. If the video was faulty, the trials were eliminated from further analysis. However, if their videos were accurate, their values were included in subsequent analysis. The number of zebrafish per age and treatment group was N = 11-16 per group for the acute study and N = 20 per group in the chronic study.

# Paragraphs
<paragraph1>
No significant effects of methylphenidate treatment were seen on behavior in the novel tank diving test. The controls had an average position of 1.66 +- 0.48 cm from the bottom of the tank and swam at an average speed of 107.0 +- 14.2 cm/min. The fish exposed to 2, 4 and 8 mg/L of methylphenidate averaged 1.78 +- 0.51, 1.62 +- 0.50 and 1.92 +- 0.48 cm from the bottom respectively and had swimming speeds of 119.3 +- 19.9, 108.3 +- 20.1 and 93.0 +- 13.1 cm/min respectively.
</paragraph1>
<paragraph2>
As shown in figure 1, there was a significant main effect of repetition of the stimulus where the first flee response was significantly greater than the second flee response (F(1,44) = 4.24, p < 0.05). There was also a significant interaction between methylphenidate and repeated stimulus presentation as displayed in figure 1 (F(3,44) = 3.28, p < 0.05). When the predator stimulus was first shown, the zebrafish in the control group fled 4.13-cm further from the screen on average than in the minute before the stimulus was shown. However, the control fish fled significantly less during the second encounter with the predator. They fled only 1.67-cm away from the screen compared to the min before the stimulus was presented. The fish exposed to the lowest dose of methylphenidate reacted in a similar way as the control group. In contrast, the fish with the 4 and 8 mg/L methylphenidate doses had significantly (p < 0.05) fled less than controls. They fled an average of 1.51 +- 1.05-cm (4-mg/L) and 1.75 +- 0.67-cm (8-mg/L) compared to 4.13 +- 0.73-cm for controls. During the second exposure to the stimulus, the control fish showed less of a flee response and there were no significant methylphenidate effects.
</paragraph2>
<paragraph3>
As shown in figure 2, there were significant main effects of methylphenidate (F(3,42) = 3.31, p < 0.05) and min (F(1,42) = 15.50, p < 0.001) on locomotor activity. Control fish increased their locomotor activity (cm/min) in response to viewing a video of the fish shoaling compared to their locomotor activity during the first min of the test when there is a control image on the screen. On average, control fish traveled 118.8-cm in the first min. In min 2-6, they swam an average of 144.2-cm/min, 214.4-cm/min, 194.3-cm/min, 209.3-cm/min, and 195.0-cm/min respectively. All three groups of zebrafish exposed to methylphenidate showed similar locomotor activity in the first min compared to controls; however, they never increased their swimming speed in later min as the controls did such that the methylphenidate-induced differences became more pronounced. When the shoaling video was playing in min 2-6, all of the doses of methylphenidate caused significantly decreased locomotor activity compared to controls (p < 0.05 for 2-mg/L, 8-mg/L; p<0.005 for 4-mg/L). These results are shown in figure 2. The locomotor activity when the control image played on the screen in min 1 was not statistically different for the control fish and the fish exposed to methylphenidate. There were no statistically significant differences in how close the zebrafish were to the screen across time.
</paragraph3>
<paragraph4>
As shown in figure 3, there was a main effect of minute where dive response of the zebrafish measured by the distance to the bottom of the tank (cm) varied as a function of time in the trial (F(3,284) = 34.05, p < 0.0005). The main effect of minute shows that the zebrafish engaged in a diving response and provided an internal validation check for the task. There was a significant interaction between time x methylphenidate dose (F(4,284) = 3.79, p < 0.01). Figure 3 shows the difference in trends for the distance to the bottom of the tank over time for the methylphenidate-exposed and control groups. The control and experimental fish both dove to the bottom of the tank (mean 0-mg/L = 2.67 +- 0.47 cm; mean 2-mg/L = 2.62 +- 0.45). As more time past, the control group explored the tank more rapidly over the time of the test reaching a mean of 4.52 +- 0.56 cm in min five whereas the zebrafish dosed in 2-mg/L methylphenidate explored the tank more cautiously reaching a mean of 3.98 +- 0.39 cm in min five. Figure 4 shows that across age groups, the fish dosed with methylphenidate were less excitable and did not explore as much following a dive response. There is an age effect where the younger fish (14-dpf and 21-dpf) show a more robust dive response and are slightly more willing to explore the tank than their 28-dpf counterparts. There were no statistically significant differences between swimming speeds between any of the groups.
</paragraph4>
<paragraph5>
There was a main effect of whether the predator stimulus was on or predator stimulus was off on the total distance that the zebrafish traveled across all ages and doses (F(1,54) = 6.50, p < 0.025). When predator stimulus was on, the fish exhibited more freezing behaviors and moved significantly less compared to the amount they moved when the predator stimulus was off. Zebrafish in all the groups moved less when the threat stimulus was on. There were no significant differences between groups or main effects when measuring flee responses.
