# Methods
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals, synthesis and characterization of SAP
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, while sunitinib was from Selleckchem, USA. SAP was synthesized as shown in Figure 1 and described in the Supplementary Materials sections (S.I.1). Mass Spectrometry (MS) was employed to define the key spectral features necessary for the quantification of all molecules in blood and tissue as described previously. Total polar surface area (PSA) and clog P values were predicted by Chemdraw Ultra (v10, PerkinElmer Informatics). The GST-fusion proteins and the antibodies used for this study are summarized in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 respectively.
Computational methods
Detailed docking and molecular dynamic analysis for all the compounds is described in the S.I.2.
In vitro evaluation
The trans-phosphorylation activity of VEGFR-2, PDGFR-beta, KIT, FLT3, RET and EGFR was evaluated as described before. Detailed methods and a list of the kinases used are available in the S.I.3. Cellular inhibition of autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-beta was performed as described in the S.I.4. For cellular studies, cells were used within six months of purchase and were cultured as instructed by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC-LGC Standards, Germany). All cell lines were obtained from the ATCC while HUVEC were from Life Technologies. E0771 cells were a kind gift of Dr Fernando Rodriguez-Serrano (University of Granada) and were grown as described previously. Cell toxicity was measured by the MTT assay.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
All animal procedures were approved by the Bioethical Committee of BRFAA based on the European Directive 86/609. For pharmacokinetic studies, female NOD/SCID mice (Charles River, Italy) were used (8-10 weeks old, n = 6 per group). Dosing solutions of SAP (100 mumol/Kg) were prepared in 20% 2-hydroxypropyl beta-Cyclodextrin in sterile water (HP-b-CD). SAP was administered intraperitoneally (IP) or orally and blood samples were collected and prepared as described previously.
In vivo efficacy
For the xenograft studies, female NOD/SCID mice were injected in each flank with 3 x106 HCC1954 (HER2 amplified) or MDA-MB-231 (TNBC) cells, while for the syngeneic animal model 1 x 106 E0771 cells were implanted ectopically in the flanks or orthotopicaly in the fat-pad of the right inguinal mammary gland in female C57BL/6 mice as described before. In every case pharmacological treatment was initiated when tumors reached 100-150 mm3 by daily IP administrations of sunitinib or equimolar doses of SAP (100 mumol/Kg, in HP-b-CD). Control mice received HP-b-CD while tumor growth and phenotypic signs of discomfort such as altered behaviour, guarding, mutilation or loss of appetite were constantly monitored during the course of treatment. Experiments were terminated after 18 days, at 1h after the last administered dose by euthanizing the animals under isoflurane anesthesia. Tumors were excised, weighed and prepared for kinase activity, histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantification of compounds of interest by LC-MS/MS.
Immunohistochemistry
Excised tumors were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained against CD31, Ki-67, pErk1/2 and pS6. Microvessel density was assessed by counting the number of CD31+ vessels in a 40x microscope field in a blinded fashion and presented as the amount of blood vessels/mm2. To determine proliferation indices (PI), Ki67 positive or negative cells were counted using ImageJ software (US National Institutes of Health) in 3-4 representative fields of five tumors for each treatment (on average, ~900 nuclei were counted per specimen). Images were acquired by a Leica DFC350-FX camera mounted on a Leica DMLS2 microscope.
In vivo kinase activity
The PathScan intracellular signaling array kit (Cell Signaling, UK) was used as per manufacturer's direction to detect the phosphorylation status in supernatants from tumor extracts (n = 10 for each treatment). Images were analyzed with ImageJ software (v1.28) by loading the image as a gray scale picture and the average intensity for each kinase was calculated as described previously.
Toxicity evaluation
C57BL/6 female mice (n = 8) were used, treated for one week with daily IP administrations of HP-b-CD or 100 mumol/Kg of SAP or sunitinib. Cardiotoxicity was assessed as described previously. For the hematotoxicity experiments approximately 300 muL of blood were collected from each animal in a vacutainer blood collection tube containing EDTA (BD Biosciences). Blood analysis was performed directly after sampling in a MEK-6318J/K hematology analyzer (Nihon Kohden Corp, Japan) and the parameters measured were red and white blood cell numbers, platelets hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean cell volume (MCV) and mean cell hemoglobin.
Zebrafish experiments
Zebrafish embryos were maintained and raised as described previously. The experimental protocols described in this study were carried out with zebrafish larvae up to 96 h post fertilization (hpf) and therefore are not subject to the regulations of European animal protection guidelines. The Tg(kdrl:gfp)s483 transgenic line was used. For the bioaccumulation experiments, synchronized 24 hpf Tg(kdrl:gfp)s483 embryos were exposed to 50 muM sunitinib or SAP with final concentration 0.1% (v/v) DMSO (vehicle) in embryo medium (0.3 g/L "Instant Ocean" Sea Salts and 0.08 g/L CaSO4*2H2O). Treatments were performed in three independent experiments with 50 embryos per experimental sample. Embryo and water samples were collected at 1 min and 24 h post treatment. After exposure, embryos were rinsed with fresh embryo medium, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C. For monitoring the antiangiogenic activity of SAP and sunitinib Tg(kdrl:gfp)s483 embryos were treated at 24 hpf with 50 muM of the compounds or vehicle and images were taken at 48 hpf.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses and calculation of all IC50 s were performed by SigmaPlot12 software and statistical significance was determined using the Student's two-tailed, two-sample unequal variance distribution t test. Comparison of means among three study groups was made by using one-way ANOVA followed by the post hoc Turkey-Kramer multiple comparison test using StatPlus (v6, Analysoft). A two-sided (P < .01) was considered statistically significant.

# Paragraphs
<paragraph>
The synthetic route for SAP is shown in Figure 1A while the accurate chemical structure was verified by 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) (Figure 1B). SAP retained the indolin-2-one core of sunitinib responsible for RTK inhibition, while it provided a handle for conjugation to a targeting peptide or antibody through the amino group of piperazine. Figure 1C depicts the MS features as well as some key properties of SAP. The lipophilicity of SAP was calculated to be lower than sunitinib (cLogP = 1.5 vs 2.9 of sunitinib), and the calculated 2D PSA of SAP is higher in comparison to sunitinib (85.5 A2 vs 73.5 A2 of sunitinib). The calculated percent absorption (%ABS = 80, calculated using: %ABS = 109 - 0.345 PSA), and the degree of blood brain barrier permeability (logBB = -0.9 calculated using: logBB = -0.0148 PSA + 0.152 cLogP + 0.139) suggest a good absorption and poor brain permeability profile of SAP with respect to other angiogenesis inhibitors. A representative mass spectrum for SAP and an LC-MS/MS chromatogram (depicting the Z and E isomers of SAP) are shown in Figure 1D-1F.
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
Molecular docking calculations were performed for SAP in comparison with sunitinib, which were based on the X-ray structures of VEGFR-2 and KIT complexes with sunitinib, and a homology model of PDGFR-beta (Supporting Information SI2). The inhibition constants of SAP and sunitinib were estimated to be comparable (at the low nanomolar range), and representative molecular models of SAP bound to the ATP-binding site of SAP complexed with these RTKs are shown in Figure 2A.
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
The potency of SAP was evaluated in biochemical assays employing the known RTK targets of sunitinib (VEGFR-2, PDGFR-beta, KIT, FLT3 and RET) and against the EGFR as a negative control (Figure 2B). SAP inhibited most of these RTKs with comparable affinity with respect to sunitinib (IC50 = 61-102 nmol/L), a result confirming out design strategy. An interesting observation was the superior potency of SAP over sunitinib in inhibiting RET (IC50 = 102 vs 699 nmol/L), a finding that merits further investigation.
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
The inhibition of phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-beta was further confirmed in HUVEC and NIH/3T3 cells, using a Western blot based cellular ligand-dependent phosphorylation assay (Figure 2C). The calculated cellular IC50 values for sunitinib were 24 +- 12 nmol/L (for VEGFR-2) and 72 +- 19 nmol/L (for PDGFR-beta) respectively. Similar potencies were observed for SAP with cellular IC50 values of 52 +- 14 nmol/L for VEGFR-2 and 76 +- 22 nmol/L for PDGFR-beta.
</paragraph>
<paragraph>
The antiproliferative effect of SAP was assessed in several cell lines including three luminal (MCF7, T47D, ZR75-1), one basal TNBC (MDA-MB-231) and two HER2 amplified (HCC1954, SKBR3) BrCa subtypes, as well as the endothelial cell line HUVEC. Results and comparative IC50 values are presented in Figure 2D. SAP was equipotent to sunitinib, but also to our previously generated SAN1 molecule in all cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 6.5 +- 2.4 mumol/L to 15.8 +- 1.7 mumol/L.</paragraph>
