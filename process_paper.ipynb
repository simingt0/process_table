The distribution of a single dose of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-stabilized AgNP was investigated in pregnant rats. Two sizes of AgNP, 20 and 110 nm, and silver acetate (AgAc) were used to investigate the role of AgNP diameter and particle dissolution in tissue distribution, internal dose, and persistence. Dams were administered AgNP or AgAc intravenously (i.v.) (1 mg/kg) or by gavage (p.o.) (10 mg/kg), or vehicle alone, on gestation day 18 and euthanized at 24 or 48 h post-exposure. The silver concentration in tissues was measured using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The distribution of silver in dams was influenced by route of administration and AgNP size. The highest concentration of silver (mug Ag/g tissue) at 48 h was found in spleen for i.v. administered AgNP, and in lungs for AgAc. At 48 h following p.o. administration of AgNP, the highest concentration was measured in cecum and large intestine, and for AgAc in placenta. Silver was detected in placenta and fetuses for all groups. Markers of cardiovascular injury, oxidative stress marker, cytokines, and chemokines were not significantly elevated in exposed dams compared to vehicle-dosed control. NMR metabolomics analysis of urine indicated that AgNP and AgAc exposure impact the carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism. This study demonstrates that silver crosses the placenta and is transferred to the fetus regardless of the form of silver.</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">INTRO</infon><infon key=\"type\">title_1</infon><offset>2222</offset><text>INTRODUCTION</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">INTRO</infon><infon key=\"type\">paragraph</infon><offset>2235</offset><text>The broad-spectrum bactericidal properties of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) have led to their widespread use in industries, including textile, personal hygiene, medical applications, and other consumer products. The integration of silver nanomaterials to such a broad selection of products increases the risk of human exposure, both through direct exposure and environmental exposure. This practice makes it essential to understand the potential risks and effects that AgNP exposure poses on human health. In addition, maternal exposure during pregnancy may have effects on the developing fetus, and it is therefore important to understand the distribution, internal dose, persistence, and potential maternal-fetal transfer of nanosilver during pregnancy in order to perform meaningful health risk assessments.</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">INTRO</infon><infon key=\"type\">paragraph</infon><offset>3044</offset><text>Nanosized particles have been demonstrated to cross the human placenta ex vivo. The gestational/lactational translocation of particles has been demonstrated in rodents, including titanium dioxide (TiO2), diesel exhaust particles, and fullerene C60. A few studies have investigated the transfer of AgNP across the placenta in rats and mice. Following intravenous (i.v.) administration of AgNP in pregnant mice, silver was detected in extra-embryonic tissues (visceral yolk sac, placenta, and endometrium), and embryos. Silver was also found the placenta and fetal tissues of mice following intraperitoneal administration of AgNP, and while the highest dosing concentration resulted in the highest recovered dose in the placenta, the lowest dose resulted in the highest detected silver concentrations in the embryo and fetal liver. Transfer of silver through placenta or breast milk to fetuses and pups in rats, respectively, have been demonstrated following gavage (p.o.) administration of AgNP.</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">INTRO</infon><infon key=\"type\">paragraph</infon><offset>4039</offset><text>The mechanisms and consequences of prenatal exposure to AgNP in fetuses and offspring are not yet well understood. No teratogenicity on skeletal system was observed in the offspring of rats exposed prenatally to AgNP, but the placenta from exposed dams were smaller in weight, volume and width. Silver has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier as well as the cerebrospinal fluid barrier to enter tissues of the central nervous system in animals. Following oral AgNP administration in pregnant rats, silver was found to reach the offspring's brain. After prenatal exposure to AgNP, silver was detected in hippocampus tissues of offspring, as was cell apoptosis. That prenatal exposure to AgNP can induce apoptosis in the brains of newborn rats, was confirmed by the findings of elevated expression of the apoptosis mediator, procaspase-3. Also, the growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) a neuron-specific phosphoprotein that plays a major role in initial development and remodeling of neural connections, was found in significant lower levels in the hippocampus of rat offspring following prenatal exposure to AgNP compared to controls. Wu and colleagues also found that offspring at postnatal day 35 performed less well in the Morris Water Maze, suggesting impaired spatial cognition in rat offspring following prenatal exposure. Postnatal neurobehavioral disorders as a resulting from prenatal exposure to AgNP has also been reported in mice.</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">INTRO</infon><infon key=\"type\">paragraph</infon><offset>5489</offset><text>The metabolomics analysis of responses to chemical exposure, including ENMs, have been studied, and utilized as a discovery tool, to determine the metabolites that are affected by exposure.

To study maternal-fetal transfer, embryology, and reproductive toxicology, the rat is a commonly used and well-characterized model. Herein we report the results of a comprehensive investigation of the distribution and maternal-fetal transfer of AgNP in pregnant rats after administration of a single i.v. or p.o. dose. This study was conducted as part of a National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Centers for Nanotechnology Health Implications Research (NCNHIR) Consortium investigation of the role of size and surface coating on the effects of nanosilver. To investigate the role of nanoparticle size in tissue distribution and biological outcome, two AgNP sizes were chosen, 20 and 110 nm. This paper describes the investigation of PVP coated particles, and the results of the investigation of citrate coated particles will be reported in a separate paper. The two sizes were selected to encompass the range of sizes of commercially available nanosilver. The i.v. route was chosen to examine tissue distribution and elimination of silver in pregnant rats while avoiding absorption from the intestinal tract, and first pass elimination in the liver, and the oral route was chosen to investigate ingestion of nanosilver. The levels of markers for cardiovascular injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation were measured to study the responses in dams of AgNP exposure. Metabolomics analysis of urine was performed to investigate the biochemical changes caused by AgNP exposure. The results presented here are basic to an understanding of the distribution, internal dose, persistence, and biological impacts of AgNP in pregnant rats.</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">METHODS</infon><infon key=\"type\">title_1</infon><offset>7962</offset><text>METHODS</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">METHODS</infon><infon key=\"type\">title_2</infon><offset>7970</offset><text>Characterization of Silver Nanoparticle (AgNP)</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">METHODS</infon><infon key=\"type\">paragraph</infon><offset>8017</offset><text>In this study PVP-stabilized 20 or 110 nm AgNP, 1 mg Ag/mL in sterile water (Nanotechnology Characterization Lab [NCL] IDs NIEHS-2 and NIEHS-4, respectively), manufactured by nanoComposix, Inc. and supplied to the Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory (NCL) were used.

Dosing solution of AgNP were prepared by using AgNP suspensions as supplied and mixed well prior to administration. Silver acetate (AgAc) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was PVP-stabilized in 100 mug PVP/mL of water at a concentration of 1.55 mg/mL (1 mg Ag/mL). Rats were weighed before dosing, and the dose administered was determined by the syringe difference method. The charged syringe was weighed prior to dosing and the empty syringe was weighed after dosing. The exact dose administered was determined as the difference between the weight measurements. The AgNP and AgAc doses administered were calculated based on the weight of the dose administered and the concentration of the dosing solution. Dosing information was collected and calculated in a Debra  data collection and reporting system (LabLogic Systems Ltd., Sheffield, England). Intravenous doses (i.v.) were administered via a lateral tail vein at a concentration of 1 mg Ag/kg body weight, and oral doses were administered by oral gavage (p.o.) at a concentration of 10 mg Ag/kg body weight. Each dosing group had 6 dams. Control dams received vehicle doses of 100 mug PVP/mL in water at 1 mL/kg i.v. or 10 mL/kg p.o. The dose for i.v. administration was selected to be well under the lethal dose for i.v. exposure in mice of &gt;200 mg Ag/kg. The dose of 10 mg/kg selected for p.o. is equivalent to 2000 times the reference dose for daily oral exposure to silver by EPA, but not toxic in mice at repeated daily doses. Dams were placed in glass metabolism cages that allow for separate collection of urine and feces on dry ice. Urine and feces were collected at 24 h intervals, prior to dosing (0h), 24 and 48h post administration. Three dams per group were euthanized at 24 and 48 h post exposure and tissues: blood, brain, heart, kidney, liver, spleen, lung, pancreas, stomach and small intestine (upper GI tract), large intestine and cecum (lower GI tract), skin, bone (femur), carcass, fetus, and placenta were collected, weighed, and stored frozen (-20  C). A portion of each blood sample was processed to plasma for biomarker analysis and the remainder was used for silver analysis. Blood volume in rats was estimated to be 7.4% of body weight based on the literature, muscles to be 40.43%, bones 7.3%, and skin 19.03%.</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">METHODS</infon><infon key=\"type\">title_2</infon><offset>11909</offset><text>Measurement of Silver Content in Tissues</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">METHODS</infon><infon key=\"type\">paragraph</infon><offset>11950</offset><text>Quantitative analysis of silver in tissues and excreta was conducted by ICP-MS, adapted from methods described previously.

Sample preparation was conducted in a room equipped with yellow lights to minimize the potential for photo-oxidation of silver. The silver concentration for all samples was analyzed using an X-Series I ICP-MS (Thermo Electron Corporation, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a concentric glass nebulizer and Peltier-cooled glass spray chamber. Quality control samples were processed with the study samples to monitor method performance, including pre-digestion spiked method blanks. The quantification limit was 0.5 ng Ag/mL digested solution, with a linear range from 0.5 to 100 ng/mL.

In short, to 540 muL of urine, 60 muL of Chenomx ISTD solution (Chenomx, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) and two internal standards [4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS) and imidazole] were added. The internal standards were used for line shape analysis and chemical shift referencing, pH determination, and metabolite identification using the NMR library in Chenomx NMR Suite 8.1 Professional software (Chenomx, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). A 500 muL aliquot of sample was transferred into a 5 mm NMR tubes. A Bruker Avance III 700 MHz NMR spectrometer (located at the David H. Murdock Research Institute at Kannapolis, NC, USA) using the first increment of a NOESY sequence, with a 100 ms mixing time, a 2 s relaxation delay, a spectral width of 16 ppm, 32k data points, and 32 transients were used to acquire 1H NMR spectra. All 1H NMR spectra were collected at 25  C, zero filled, and Fourier transformed after exponential multiplication with a line broadening factor of 0.5. The water resonance was suppressed using resonance irradiation during the relaxation delay and mixing time. Phase and baseline of the spectra were manually corrected for each spectrum, and spectra were referenced to DSS (delta 0 ppm).

Briefly, NMR data were processed by automated integration (increments of 0.04 ppm) over the spectral window (binning), excluding the region of water suppression, and DSS signal, and intensities each of the bins was normalized to the total integral of the bins of each spectrum. Normalized binned data (bin region and integral value) were transported for data reduction and visualization using SIMCA-P+ 13.0 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). SIMCA-P+ 13.0 for the binned data were used to generate principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Data were preprocessed by mean centering and Pareto scaling prior to multivariate data analysis. Loadings plots and variable importance for projection (VIP) plots were investigated to determine the bins that best define the separation of exposure groups and those bins were matched to metabolites using Chenomx NMR Suite 8.1 Professional software.

In contrast, for AgAc dosed dams, the highest concentration of silver at 48 h was found in lungs (1.3 mug Ag/g). At 48 h post administration, the second highest concentration of silver in AgAc and 20 nm AgNP exposed dams was detected in placenta (0.8 mug Ag/g and 0.9 mug Ag/g, respectively), while for dams administered 110 nm AgNP, the second highest concentrations were found in liver (2.7 mug Ag/g), followed by the placenta (1.1 mug Ag/g). Silver concentration in liver was dependent on AgNP size, such that the concentrations of silver were an order of magnitude higher for 110 nm AgNP dosed dams (2.7 mug Ag/g) than for 20 nm AgNP (0.2 mug Ag/g). Silver was measured in fetuses for all three forms of silver and increased from 24 to 48 h post administration. The results show that silver crosses the placenta regardless of its form, and that the concentration is similar in the placenta between 24 and 48 h. However, the concentrations of silver in placenta were higher than the concentrations measured in blood, and also higher than the concentration measured in fetuses. Levels at least 3-fold above background were also detected in blood, liver, spleen, lungs, heart, kidney, bone, stomach and small intestine, cecum and large intestine, and pancreas for all three forms of nanosilver.

Few studies have reported the disposition, persistence, and fate of AgNP in pregnancy and potential maternal-fetal transfer, and understanding these parameters in biological systems is the basis for toxicology and risk assessment.</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">DISCUSS</infon><infon key=\"type\">paragraph</infon><offset>29205</offset><text>Here, a comprehensive investigation of silver distribution in pregnant rats was conducted following a single i.v. or p.o. dose of PVP-stabilized AgAc, 20 nm AgNP, 110 nm AgNP or vehicle control to provide data for modeling of risks associated with exposure to nanosilver during pregnancy. Following i.v. administration of 20 nm AgNP, spleen was the tissue at 48 h found to contain the highest concentration of silver, followed by placenta&gt;lungs&gt;cecum and large intestine ~ liver ~ blood ~ kidney ~ skin. After i.v. administration of 110 nm AgNP, the highest silver concentration in tissue at 48 h was also found in spleen, followed by the liver&gt;placenta&gt;cecum and large intestine&gt;blood ~ kidneys ~ lung. At 48 h following i.v. administration of AgAc, the highest silver concentration was found in the lungs followed by placenta&gt;spleen ~ liver ~ cecum and large intestine. The silver concentration in spleen of dams receiving 20 nm AgNP i.v. was found to be 2-fold lower than in 110 nm AgNP dosed dams, while the silver concentration in the liver was an order of magnitude lower. It has been suggested that NP smaller than the pores of liver fenestrae (~100 nm) can be taken up by the liver, whereas larger particles are absorbed with greater affinity in the spleen.</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">DISCUSS</infon><infon key=\"type\">paragraph</infon><offset>30471</offset><text>Excretion of silver through the feces via the liver following i.v. exposure could either happen as free ions, as in the case of AgAc, or possibly as NP. Hepato-biliary excretion has been demonstrated to be dependent on NP size, so that smaller NP are excreted faster than larger NP. Here we found that the recovered percentage of silver in feces were similar for 20 nm and 110 nm AgNP dosed dams at 48 h (10% and 6%, respectively), while the recovered percentage in feces for AgAc dosed dams were several fold higher (39%). Excretion of silver through urine was minimal following both i.v. and p.o. administration, and the concentration of silver in the kidneys was low for all three groups (0.2-0.5 mug/g tissue). For quantum dots the cut-off size for renal excretion has been reported to be approximately 5.5 nm. This suggests that silver ions are not effectively excreted in urine. For p.o. administered AgNP, the highest concentrations of both sizes of AgNP were found in the cecum and large intestine, with both demonstrating a 3- to 4-fold decrease in concentration between 24 and 48 h post exposure. This observation corresponds with the high amount of silver recovered in feces. For dams receiving either size of AgNPs, the second highest concentration of silver at 48 h was found in placenta, followed by kidneys. For dams receiving AgAc p.o., the highest concentration of silver at 48 h was found in placenta, followed by cecum and large intestine&gt; liver&gt;kidneys. Low levels of silver were detected in the blood for all three animal groups at both 24 and 48 h post administration, and little of the administered dose was found in the analyzed tissues.</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">DISCUSS</infon><infon key=\"type\">paragraph</infon><offset>32133</offset><text>In this study, silver was detected in both placenta and fetus for all animal groups, illustrating that silver enters and crosses the placenta regardless of the route of administration and the form of silver. Interestingly, while the concentration of silver in the placenta was approximately 6-fold higher following i.v. administration compared to p.o. at 48 h post dosing, the placenta was the tissue with the second highest concentration of silver following p.o. administration. The concentrations of silver were approximately a magnitude higher in the placenta compared to the fetus, demonstrating that the transfer of silver to the fetus was substantially impeded by the placenta. The maternal-fetal transfer of ENMs and translocation across the placenta is not well understood, as discussed in recent reviews. The diameter of the uterine and placental blood vessels change during normal placental development. The diameter of the uterine artery measured in non-pregnant women was 1.4 mm, while at 21 week of pregnancy the diameter was 2.8 mm, increasing to 2.9 mm at week 30, and 3.4 mm at week 36. In pregnant rats at GD 20, uterine arteries reaching male or female fetuses have a diameter of 0.72 or 0.73 mm, respectively, while the diameter of radial artery is 0.63-0.65 mm and the diameter of spiral arteries are 0.15-0.16 mm. During pregnancy, the blood flow to the uterus increases from 0.1 mL/min in the non-pregnant rat, to 9 mL/min on GD 20, representing a 90-fold increase in blood flow, with approximately 6% of the cardiac output distributed to the placentas on GD 20. Here we administered silver at GD 18 and determined the concentration of silver in tissues on GD 19 and GD 20. The increased blood flow to the placenta (0.7 ml/min/g at GD 18 and 0.4 ml/min/g at GD 20) during the later stages of pregnancy ensures that a substantial portion of i.v. administered materials will distribute to the placenta. Liver receives a substantial portion of the cardiac output (blood flow is 0.1 ml/min/g at GD18 and 0.07 ml/min/g at GD 20) as well as the spleen (blood flow is 1.3 ml/min/g at GD 18 and 1.1 ml/min/g at GD 20). Interestingly, the concentration of silver in the placenta was similar to the liver for dams i.v. dosed with AgAc, while for 20 nm AgNP dosed dams it was 2-3 fold higher than in liver. In contrast, in dams receiving 110 nm AgNP, silver concentrations in placenta were approximately half that in liver. These results indicate that nanoparticle size plays a critical role in retention of material in the placenta compared with other organs. For p.o. administered materials, the concentrations of silver measured in the placenta were even more striking compared to the other tissues, since they were the highest measured at 48 h after the lower GI, and several times higher than those found in liver and spleen. It is important to remember that the placenta is not just a filter protecting the developing fetus from maternal blood substances, but also plays an important role in for example fetal brain development. The internal concentration of silver in the placenta might point to the mechanisms behind the reported impact on fetal brain and neurological development following prenatal AgNP exposure.</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">DISCUSS</infon><infon key=\"type\">paragraph</infon><offset>35367</offset><text>Circulating biomarkers like selected pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were analyzed in the plasma of pregnant rats to understand possible correlations with nanosilver exposure. Cytokine levels were consistent in nanosilver exposed dams with previous reports of limited toxicity of ENMs such as AuNP and [14C(U)]C60. Here it was found for all forms of nanosilver, that the highest cytokine levels were at 24 h post exposure. Intratracheal (i.t.) installation of citrate-capped 20 nm AgNP in male Sprague-Dawley rats revealed elevations of serum cytokines: G-CSF, MIP-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-13, IL-10, IL-18, IL-17, TNFalpha, and RANTES at 1 day post exposure, but decreased, with only IL-2, IL-13 and TNFalpha remaining elevated at day 7. In this study, markers of cardiovascular injury, PAI-1, and vWF were evaluated. PAI-1 was lower in dams receiving 110 nm AgNP i.v. compared to vehicle, AgAc, and 20 nm AgNP exposed dams, but not for p.o. administration. For 110 nm AgNP administered p.o., a lower level of vWF resulted compared to the other groups. It is possible that i.v. or p.o. exposure to nanosilver does not evoke the same cardiovascular response as i.t. exposure, or that the cardiovascular injury marker assay employed here was not as sensitive to detect possible cardiovascular responses.</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">DISCUSS</infon><infon key=\"type\">paragraph</infon><offset>36698</offset><text>Broad-spectrum NMR metabolomics analysis of urine from dams receiving nanosilver either i.v. or p.o. and collected at 48 h was conducted as a discovery tool to determine metabolites that were most important to differentiate between two sizes of AgNP and route of administration during pregnancy. Published studies of metabolomics analysis of urine obtained from female Wistar Hannover Galas rats p.o. administered PVP-stabilized 14 nm AgNP, by high performance liquid chromatography - quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, exhibited metabolic differences compared to control specimens, as an increase in levels of uric acid and allantoin utilization. In this investigation, uric acid itself was not found to be important for differentiating AgNP p.o. exposure from vehicle controls, but the degradation product of uric acid, allantoin, was found to separate p.o. administered AgAc and 110 nm AgNP (Table 10), as well as for dams dosed i.v. with 110 nm AgNP from vehicle control dams (Table 9). NMR-based metabolomics analysis has also been used to understand the exposure in rats or mice of other NP, such as TiO2, manganese oxide (MnO), MnO embedded iron oxide NP, aluminum oxide (Al2O3), silica dioxide (SiO2), zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), and barium sulfate (BaSO4). Combining results from metabolomics analysis, serum chemistry, hematology, and histopathology in male and non-pregnant female rats have indicated that a disturbance in energy and amino acid metabolism might be attributed to slight liver and heart injury caused by TiO2. MnO NP exposure in male rats was found to impact metabolites involved in lipid, energy, amino acid, and other nutrient metabolism. The metabolomics analysis of urine from exposed pregnant rats (when compared to vehicle control) demonstrated that a single AgNP dose impacted the glycosphingolipid metabolism or TCA cycle when administered i.v. and for AgNP delivered p.o., the TCA cycle and amino acid metabolism and transport are most perturbed (Table 11). It is interesting that the literature reported metabolomics analysis of the effects of NP exposure in male or non-pregnant female rodents reported changes associated with lipid, energy, amino acid, and protein metabolism pathways, and the results presented here also find perturbation in dams of energy, and amino acid metabolic pathways as a result of AgNP exposure. Collectively these data suggest that exposure to ENMs can impact metabolism, and further research is needed to determine the possible health implication of ENMs exposure in all physiological states.</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">DISCUSS</infon><infon key=\"type\">paragraph</infon><offset>39268</offset><text>It is essential to have a comprehensive knowledge of the internal dose of each ENM in tissues in order to understand its pathology and the role of the material's physiochemical properties. Several mechanisms behind adverse outcomes following exposure are possible, including direct particle exposure in tissues, or indirect effects mediated by the autonomic nervous system, systemic immunological effects, endocrine disruption, metabolic imbalance, and signaling pathways. Regardless of the mechanisms behind the adverse outcome of ENM exposure, a basic knowledge of distribution and disposition is fundamental in toxicology. Distribution, disposition, and elimination also reveal if a ENMs are persistent. Persistence (biodurability) of ENMs in biological systems is considered one of the main contributors to particle and fiber toxicity, since the longer the ENM persists, the higher the risk there is for an adverse outcome. The most classic example of the serious consequences of persistence in toxicology might be asbestos, which is not metabolized and has an estimated clearance half-time measured in years to decades. Also, in the case of persistent ENMs, the release of constituents, such as ions, from the material, may be a major cause of adverse effects. The dissolution:translocation relationship of ENMs is believed to be a central part of nanotoxicology. The toxicity of ENMs is expected to result from material properties and biological fate, with persistent ENMs, and ENMs that rapidly dissolve to release toxic constituents representing areas of concern. Our working hypothesis is that AgNPs are rapidly removed from circulation after dosing, enter into the liver and spleen, and are then slowly released back into the circulation or eliminated in feces. This contrasts with studies with other ENMs such as C60, which has very limited clearance, with less than 2% of the dose per 24 hours.</text></passage><passage><infon key=\"section_type\">DISCUSS</infon><infon key=\"type\">paragraph</infon><offset>41175</offset><text>This report has demonstrated that the distribution of silver in pregnant rats depends on both route of administration and form of nanosilver, and that maternal-fetal transfer of silver across the placenta occurs regardless of both parameters.

      "You will be given the abstract of a research paper which includes at least one animal toxicity study then a list of all the tables included in that paper, each one labeled with its title. For each table identify it as one of three categories: treatment group table (G), biomarker table (B), or other (O). Treatment group tables should contain information on the specific treatment groups, such as the medications, the dosages, the sample size, etc. Tables that only give information on the chemicals used (such as the sourcing) should not be labeled G and should instead be labeled O. Even if the table meets these criteria, only label the table G if it describes the groups of specifically an animal toxicity study within the paper. Otherwise, label it O. Biomarker tables may contain treatment group dosage information, but the main difference between is that biomarker tables should contain biomarker data observed from the treatment groups. This can frequency data (such as survival or number occurences of a condition) or metric data (such as ALT levels or compound concentration), and the table must describe the results of specifically an animal toxicity study within the paper to be labeled B. Otherwise, label it O. Any other irrelevant papers should be labeled O, such as results of in vitro assays or gene expression tables. For each table on a new line, include the label in the following format in the order that the tables are given: <table name|label>. Do not include any extra text in your answer or extra whitespace inside the labels. Here is an example input and output:\n",

      "Background: Compound ABC is a novel small molecule with potential therapeutic applications in metabolic disorders. To evaluate its safety profile, we conducted two complementary toxicity studies: an in vitro cytotoxicity assay and an in vivo rodent toxicity assessment.\n",
      "Methods:\n",
      "In vitro assay: Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and rat cardiomyoblast (H9c2) cell lines were exposed to ABC at concentrations of 1-200 µM for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay, and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI staining and caspase-3 activation.\n",
      "In vivo study: Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10 per sex per group) received daily oral doses of ABC at 0 (vehicle control), 10, 50, or 200 mg/kg for 28 days. Clinical observations, body weight, and food consumption were recorded. At study termination, hematology, serum biochemistry (ALT, AST, BUN, creatinine), and organ histopathology (liver, kidney, heart) were evaluated.\n",
      "Results:\n",
      "In vitro, ABC induced a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with IC₅₀ values of 45 µM (HepG2) and 120 µM (H9c2) at 48 h. Apoptotic indices increased significantly at ≥50 µM, accompanied by a 3-fold rise in caspase-3 activity. In vivo, no mortality or adverse clinical signs were observed at ≤50 mg/kg. Rats dosed at 200 mg/kg exhibited transient body weight suppression (5% lower vs. control), mild elevations in ALT and creatinine (1.4- and 1.3-fold, respectively), and minimal hepatocellular vacuolation on histology. No significant changes were seen in hematological parameters or cardiac histopathology.\n",
      "Conclusions: ABC demonstrates moderate cytotoxicity in vitro, primarily via apoptosis, and is well tolerated in rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in this 28-day study is 50 mg/kg. These findings support further preclinical development of ABC, with emphasis on mechanistic studies of hepatic metabolism and long-term safety.</abstract>\n",

      "<abstract>Here is presented a comprehensive investigation of the distribution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-stabilized AgNP (20 or 110 nm) in pregnant rats after a single injection or oral gavage dose. The biological impacts of AgNP exposure were evaluated by metabolomic analysis, and measurement of biomarkers of cardiovascular injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation. The investigation provided a basic understanding of the distribution, internal dose, persistence, metabolomics, and elimination of AgNP following exposure in pregnant rats.\n",
      "Few investigations have been conducted on the disposition and fate of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) in pregnancy. The distribution of a single dose of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-stabilized AgNP was investigated in pregnant rats. Two sizes of AgNP, 20 and 110 nm, and silver acetate (AgAc) were used to investigate the role of AgNP diameter and particle dissolution in tissue distribution, internal dose, and persistence. Dams were administered AgNP or AgAc intravenously (i.v.) (1 mg/kg) or by gavage (p.o.) (10 mg/kg), or vehicle alone, on gestation day 18 and euthanized at 24 or 48 h post-exposure. The silver concentration in tissues was measured using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The distribution of silver in dams was influenced by route of administration and AgNP size. The highest concentration of silver (mug Ag/g tissue) at 48 h was found in spleen for i.v. administered AgNP, and in lungs for AgAc. At 48 h following p.o. administration of AgNP, the highest concentration was measured in cecum and large intestine, and for AgAc in placenta. Silver was detected in placenta and fetuses for all groups. Markers of cardiovascular injury, oxidative stress marker, cytokines, and chemokines were not significantly elevated in exposed dams compared to vehicle-dosed control. NMR metabolomics analysis of urine indicated that AgNP and AgAc exposure impact the carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism. This study demonstrates that silver crosses the placenta and is transferred to the fetus regardless of the form of silver.</abstract>\n",
