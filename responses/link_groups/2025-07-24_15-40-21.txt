# Instructions
You will be given the methods section to a paper with an animal toxicity study as well as two tables describing the treatment groups of the paper. The first graph was derived from a graph, and the second graph was derived from the text. Your goal is to cross-reference information from both tables to identify the treatment groups in table 1. For each group in table 1, pair it with one of the groups in table 2 if you think they are referring to the same treatment group based on similarity in the metrics and group names. For each pairing, answer in the following format with each entry having its own row: <group1|group2>, where group1 is the group name from table 1 and group 2 is the group name from table 2 (here is an example: <control|Control Group>). Note that two groups could be paired even if they differ by one or two arguments. Also, the same group from table 2 can be paired to multiple groups in table 1. If none of the groups in table 2 seem like a good fit for a group in table 1, label the second group as 'NO MATCH' like so: <example group|NO MATCH>. Do not add any additional whitespace or text in your answer.
# Methods
METHODS
Characterization of Silver Nanoparticle (AgNP)
In this study PVP-stabilized 20 or 110 nm AgNP, 1 mg Ag/mL in sterile water (Nanotechnology Characterization Lab [NCL] IDs NIEHS-2 and NIEHS-4, respectively), manufactured by nanoComposix, Inc. and supplied to the Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory (NCL) were used. The size and coating were selected by the NIEHS NCNHIR Consortium. The extensive characterization by NCL of the selected AgNP were done on behalf of NIEHS, including the determination of silver concentration in the provided solution. NCL assayed each preparation in duplicate for the following: Sterility and endotoxin contamination; hydrodynamic size/size distribution by dynamic light scattering (DLS); size/size distribution by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); hydrodynamic diameter (Z-average); surface charge by Zeta potential analysis and silver concentration by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the results are summarized in Table 1. Samples of NIEHS-2 and NIEHS-4 were obtained from NCL and stored refrigerated until time of use.
Housing and Dosing Administration of Pregnant Rats
Timed pregnant Sprague Dawley rats, approximately 10 weeks old were obtained from Charles River Laboratories in Raleigh, NC. Dams were singly housed in standard polycarbonate caging and were fed Purina 5002 rodent chow and Durham (NC) municipal tap water, ad libitum. A temperature of 72 +- 3  F, relative humidity of 30-70%, and a 12:12 light cycle were maintained in the animal rooms. Dams were acclimated for 5-7 days prior to dosing.
All doses were administered on gestational day (GD) 18. Dosing solution of AgNP were prepared by using AgNP suspensions as supplied and mixed well prior to administration. Silver acetate (AgAc) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was PVP-stabilized in 100 mug PVP/mL of water at a concentration of 1.55 mg/mL (1 mg Ag/mL). Rats were weighed before dosing, and the dose administered was determined by the syringe difference method. The charged syringe was weighed prior to dosing and the empty syringe was weighed after dosing. The exact dose administered was determined as the difference between the weight measurements. The AgNP and AgAc doses administered were calculated based on the weight of the dose administered and the concentration of the dosing solution. Dosing information was collected and calculated in a Debra  data collection and reporting system (LabLogic Systems Ltd., Sheffield, England). Intravenous doses (i.v.) were administered via a lateral tail vein at a concentration of 1 mg Ag/kg body weight, and oral doses were administered by oral gavage (p.o.) at a concentration of 10 mg Ag/kg body weight. Each dosing group had 6 dams. Control dams received vehicle doses of 100 mug PVP/mL in water at 1 mL/kg i.v. or 10 mL/kg p.o. The dose for i.v. administration was selected to be well under the lethal dose for i.v. exposure in mice of >200 mg Ag/kg. The dose of 10 mg/kg selected for p.o. is equivalent to 2000 times the reference dose for daily oral exposure to silver by EPA, but not toxic in mice at repeated daily doses. Dams were placed in glass metabolism cages that allow for separate collection of urine and feces on dry ice. Urine and feces were collected at 24 h intervals, prior to dosing (0h), 24 and 48h post administration. Three dams per group were euthanized at 24 and 48 h post exposure and tissues: blood, brain, heart, kidney, liver, spleen, lung, pancreas, stomach and small intestine (upper GI tract), large intestine and cecum (lower GI tract), skin, bone (femur), carcass, fetus, and placenta were collected, weighed, and stored frozen (-20  C). A portion of each blood sample was processed to plasma for biomarker analysis and the remainder was used for silver analysis. Blood volume in rats was estimated to be 7.4% of body weight based on the literature, muscles to be 40.43%, bones 7.3%, and skin 19.03%.
Measurement of Silver Content in Tissues
Quantitative analysis of silver in tissues and excreta was conducted by ICP-MS, adapted from methods described previously. In short, an aliquot representing about half of the organ was processed per sample except for GI tissues where the whole organ was processed with contents. For each set of digestions, method blanks were prepared and analyzed to monitor background silver content. Sample preparation was conducted in a room equipped with yellow lights to minimize the potential for photo-oxidation of silver. The silver concentration for all samples was analyzed using an X-Series I ICP-MS (Thermo Electron Corporation, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a concentric glass nebulizer and Peltier-cooled glass spray chamber. Quality control samples were processed with the study samples to monitor method performance, including pre-digestion spiked method blanks. The quantification limit was 0.5 ng Ag/mL digested solution, with a linear range from 0.5 to 100 ng/mL. Quantitation limits depended on the size of feces, urine, or tissue sample used for the digestion, and were approximately 50 ng/g for feces, 5 ng/g for urine, and 12.5 ng/g for liver.
Measurements of Cardiovascular Injury Markers and Inflammation
Levels of markers for cardiovascular injury and inflammation were measured in plasma samples collected from dams following exposure to AgAc, AgNP or vehicle control. To evaluate the cardiovascular injury concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, von Willebrand factor (vWF), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and soluble e-Selectin were measured quantitatively with a Milliplex MAP Cardiovascular Immunoassay Panel (RCVD1-89k, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Inflammatory markers counted eight chemokines and cytokines: Eotaxin, interleukins; IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which were quantified utilizing Milliplex MAP Cytokine/Chemokine and Cardiovascular Immunoassay panels (RECYTMAG-65K, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Assays were run according to the manufacturer's protocol, and analyzed using a Luminex 200 (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA). The results were reported using Luminex xPONENT  software version 3.1.
Detection of 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in Urine
Levels of 8-OH-dG in urine were measured using an ELISA assay, following the instructions of the (New 8-OH-dG-Check, Jaica, Japan; Supplier: Genox, MD, USA). Following centrifuged (10 min x 5,000 g), 30 muL urine was diluted with 120 muL PBS. For the assay a 50 muL aliquot of the diluted samples were used. Statistical analyses were performed using a Wilcoxon matched pairs test using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (San Diego, CA) and significant differences were p <0.05.
NMR Metabolomic Analysis of Urine
Metabolomic analysis was done on urine samples collected from dams at 48 h post exposure to vehicle, AgAc, 20 nm or 110 nm AgNP. The sample preparation for NMR metabolomics analysis has been described previously. In short, to 540 muL of urine, 60 muL of Chenomx ISTD solution (Chenomx, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) and two internal standards [4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS) and imidazole] were added. The internal standards were used for line shape analysis and chemical shift referencing, pH determination, and metabolite identification using the NMR library in Chenomx NMR Suite 8.1 Professional software (Chenomx, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). A 500 muL aliquot of sample was transferred into a 5 mm NMR tubes. A Bruker Avance III 700 MHz NMR spectrometer (located at the David H. Murdock Research Institute at Kannapolis, NC, USA) using the first increment of a NOESY sequence, with a 100 ms mixing time, a 2 s relaxation delay, a spectral width of 16 ppm, 32k data points, and 32 transients were used to acquire 1H NMR spectra. All 1H NMR spectra were collected at 25  C, zero filled, and Fourier transformed after exponential multiplication with a line broadening factor of 0.5. The water resonance was suppressed using resonance irradiation during the relaxation delay and mixing time. Phase and baseline of the spectra were manually corrected for each spectrum, and spectra were referenced to DSS (delta 0 ppm). Assessment of the quality of each NMR spectrum was done for the level of noise and alignment of identified markers.
Analysis of NMR spectra was conducted as previously described. Briefly, NMR data were processed by automated integration (increments of 0.04 ppm) over the spectral window (binning), excluding the region of water suppression, and DSS signal, and intensities each of the bins was normalized to the total integral of the bins of each spectrum. Normalized binned data (bin region and integral value) were transported for data reduction and visualization using SIMCA-P+ 13.0 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). SIMCA-P+ 13.0 for the binned data were used to generate principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Data were preprocessed by mean centering and Pareto scaling prior to multivariate data analysis. Loadings plots and variable importance for projection (VIP) plots were investigated to determine the bins that best define the separation of exposure groups and those bins were matched to metabolites using Chenomx NMR Suite 8.1 Professional software. The library matched marker metabolites that best differentiated the study groups were used for pathway mapping using MetaCore module in GeneGo (Thompson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA), and descriptive statistics were calculated using SAS 9.4.
