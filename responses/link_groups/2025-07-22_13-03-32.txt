# Instructions
You will be given the methods section to a paper with an animal toxicity study as well as two tables describing the treatment groups of the paper. The first graph was derived from a graph, and the second graph was derived from the text. Your goal is to cross-reference information from both tables to identify the treatment groups in table 1. For each group in table 1, pair it with one of the groups in table 2 if you think they are referring to the same treatment group based on similarity in the metrics and group names. For each pairing, answer in the following format with each entry having its own row: <group1|group2>, where group1 is the group name from table 1 and group 2 is the group name from table 2 (here is an example: <control|Control Group>). Note that two groups could be paired even if they differ by one or two arguments. Also, the same group from table 2 can be paired to multiple groups in table 1. If none of the groups in table 2 seem like a good fit for a group in table 1, label the second group as 'NO MATCH' like so: <example group|NO MATCH>. Do not add any additional whitespace or text in your answer.
# Methods
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Wistar strain male albino rats (200-220 g) were maintained under standard laboratory conditions with water and food. For the folate-deficient group, folate-deficient diet was provided for 45 days prior to the experiment and methotrexate (MTX) was administered for a week before the experiment. The animals were handled according to the principles of laboratory care framed by the committee for the purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), Government of India. Prior to the experimentation, proper approval was obtained from the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (No: 01/032/2010/Aug-11).
2.2. Chemicals
Aspartame and Methotrexate were purchased from Sigma chemical company, St. Louis, MO, USA. Nitric oxide assay kit was purchased from Biovision, USA. Taq-Polymerase, DNTPs from Genet Bio, China, Reverse Transcriptase enzyme kit from Thermo scientific, USA, primary antibody was purchased from Sigma and Cell signalling, USA, secondary antibody was purchased from Merck and other molecular grade chemicals were from Merck Bangalore, India. All other chemicals were of analytical grade obtained from the Sisco research laboratory, Bombay, India.
2.3. Experimental design
The European Food Safety Authority recently confirmed its daily acceptable intake (ADI) for aspartame as 40 mg/kg b.wt./day. In order to confine within the human permitted exposure limit, this dose was selected. Aspartame (Sigma Aldrich, USA) was administered orally; (40 mg/kg b.wt) mixed 1:1 with 0.9% saline and this dosage based on the food and drug administration (FDA) approved ADI limit.
2.4. Groups
The rats were randomly divided into three groups, namely, saline control, folate deficient (MTX treated) control, and MTX-treated (folate deficient) + aspartame administered groups. Each group consisted of six animals. Methotrexate (MTX) in sterile saline was administered (0.2 mg/kg/day) subcutaneously for 7 days to folate-deficient groups. After 7 days of administration with MTX, folate deficiency was confirmed by estimating the urinary excretion of for-maminoglutamic acid (FIGLU). From the eighth day, the MTX-treated (folate deficient) (third) groups were administered orally with aspartame for 90 days, whereas the saline control or vehicle control and (folate deficient) MTX treated control groups received equivalent volumes of saline as an oral dose and all animals were handled similarly.
2.5. Brain collection and dissection
The animals were sacrificed using higher dose of long acting pentothal sodium (100 mg/kg.b.wt). Collection of the blood samples and isolation of brain was performed between 8 and 10 a.m. to avoid circadian rhythm-induced changes. The brain was immediately removed and washed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Further dissection was made on ice cold glass plate. The discrete regions of the brain (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, midbrain, Pons medulla, hippocampus and hypothalamus) were dissected according the method given in our previous publication. The homogenate (10% w/v) of the individual regions was prepared in a Teflon-glass tissue homogenizer, using ice-cold PBS (100 mM, pH 7.4) buffer and centrifuged separately in refrigerated centrifuge 4  C at 3000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was used for analyzing the biochemical estimations in this study. The body weight was recorded every week to monitor the influence of the aspartame treatment period.
2.6. Estimation of plasma corticosterone and LD50 of aspartame by Karber's method
Plasma corticosterone was estimated by the method given by Clark. The method is based on the oxidation of corticosteroids with iron (III) in acidic medium and subsequent complex of iron (II) with potassium hexacynoferrate (III). The method offers the advantage of sensitivity and stability. The absorbance was measured at 780 nm in spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800). The level of corticosterone in the plasma was expressed as mumolar (muM). The calculation of LD50 by the method of Karber was used for the determination of LD50 of aspartame in Wistar albino rats. LD50 = LD100 -  (a x b)n. n = number of rats in a group. a = difference between two successive doses of aspartame administered. b = average number of dead animals in two successive aspartame doses. LD100 = Lethal dose causing the 100% death of all rats.
2.7. Estimation of membrane bound enzymes
The activity of Na+/K+ ATPase (ATP: Phosphohydrolase - EC. 3.6.1.3.) in the tissue was estimated by the method of Bernabe et al.. The activity of Ca2+-ATPase (ATP: Phosphohydrolase - EC. 3.6.1.3.) in the tissues was estimated as described by Hjerten and Pan and the activity of Mg2+-ATPase (ATP: Phosphohydrolase - EC. 3.6.1.3.) in the tissues was estimated by the methods of Ohnishi et al..
2.8. Estimation of acetylcholine esterase (AChE)
The activity of Acetylcholine esterase in the tissues was estimated by the method of Ellman et al.. The Principle of the method being the measurement of the rate of production of thiocholine as acetylthiocholine is hydrolysed. This is accomplished by the continuous reaction of the thiol with 5:5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoate iron (I) 5 to produce the yellow anion of 5-thio-2-nitro-benzoic acid (II). The rate of colour production is measured at 412 nm.
2.9. Determination of nitrite using nitric oxide assay kit
To investigate nitric oxide formation it is essential to measure nitrite (NO2) which is one of two primary stable and nonvolatile breakdown products of NO. This assay relies on a diazotization reaction that was originally described by Griess. The original reaction has been described as a Griess reagent system is based on the chemical reaction, which uses sulfanilamide and N-1-napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NED) under acidic (phosphoric acid) conditions.
2.10. Measurement of memory in Y maze and Morris water maze
The Y maze measures spatial working and recognition memory by making use of a rodent's natural exploratory instincts. In Y-maze the three arms were marked as A, B, C and "C" is marked as the novel arm (blocked arm) to test the spatial working memory. The first session measures spatial working memory in the rat by scoring the number of alternations the rat does in Y-maze when the animal visits all three arms without going into the same arm twice in a row. If working memory is intact, the rat should remember the first two arms and be more inquisitive about the third arm (originally blocked arm). In the second session open the blocked arm and the rats were left 5 min of time to evaluate the spatial recognition memory. A rat with a normal memory should spend more time exploring the "new" unblocked arm. The alternations for the first 2 min were calculated. The overall percentage for 5 min and the percentage for the first 2 min were also calculated for spatial working and recognition memory. The Morris water maze (MWM) test consists of a circular pool made of non-toxic white metal, filled with water and maintained at 21 +- 1  C. A platform was placed 1 cm below the water surface at a fixed position. Animals were acclimatized and trained. Animals were monitored using an automated tracking system (Ethovision software). Visible platform trials were performed to evaluate sensorimotor and/or motivational deficits that could influence performance during the learning task. Hidden-platform training consisted of 6 days with each day comprised four trials with a 60min interval. The platform location remained constant in the hidden platform trials, and the entry point was changed randomly in all days. Memory retention was assessed by a probe trial after the 6 days hidden-platform training. The time spent in the target quadrant without the platform was taken to measure level of memory retention in the probe trial.
2.11. Isolation of total RNA & reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol reagent following the method given in our previous publication. The total RNA obtained was free from protein and DNA contamination. The reverse transcription step was performed by using the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme kit. Each 20 muL reaction mixture contained 5 muL OligodT (10 muM), 1 muL dNTP (10 muM), 4 muL First Strand buffer (5x), 0.2 muL super script III reverse transcriptase (200 U/muL) varied quantity of RNA template (dependent on RNA concentration) and RNase free water to make up the volume. Thermal cycling conditions for the first strand reaction consisted of 25  C for 5 min, 50  C for 45 min, 70  C for 15 min and finally maintained at 4  C for 5 min. PCR amplification was performed using Taq DNA Polymerase. Each 20 muL of sample contained 10 muL Master mix (2 muM), 1 muL forward primer, 1 muL reverse primer (Table 3) for both gene of interest and internal control consecutively, 2 muL RT sample, 4 muL sterile water. The mixture was kept at thermocycler and amplified for 35 cycles. Each thermocycling consisted of 94  C for 30 s, varied annealing temperature for each gene of interest for 30 s, 72  C for 30 s. beta-actin was co amplified with c-fos, iNOS, nNOS, Hsp70 genes using the same procedures. The sense and antisense primer for the study is tabulated in table. Ten microliters of each PCR product was analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel. Agarose gel electrophoresis is an effective method for the identification of purified DNA molecules. Amplified product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining. Then the gel containing cDNA was visualized with the help of the fluorescent imager (Bio-Rad, USA). The Band intensity was quantified by Quantity One Software. The band intensification for each enzyme mRNA was normalized with that of the internal control beta-actin using Quantity One Software.
2.12. Histopathology
Animals were deeply anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride. Rats were then perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by buffered 10% formalin. The brain was removed, and preserved in formalin until processed for histology. Then kept on running water to remove formalin pigments and dehydrated with ascending grades of alcohol. After impregnation with paraffin wax, the paraffin blocks were made. They were processed and sections were cut with 10 nm in thickness using "Spencer Lens, rotatory microtome (No 820, New York, USA) and then stained with Cresyl fast violet as follows for the brain.
2.13. Immunohistochemical analysis
Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out using the DAB universal staining kit (Merck Genie, Bengaluru, India). The sections were deparaffinized in xylene and dehydrated in ethanol. After washing with PBS, slides were incubated with 3% H2O2 in at room temperature for 15 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. After antigen retrieval (15 min of autoclaving in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0), the slides were incubated with blocking solution (10% normal goat serum) for 5 min at room temperature. Then, the sections were incubated overnight with primary antibody. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) secondary link antibody for 30 min at room temperature, washed with PBS. Then, the sections were treated with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen for 15 min. Finally, the sections were washed with deionised water, counter stained with haematoxylin and mounted. Photographs were taken using Nikon microscope (Nikon 1.25X Japan DS-Fi1).
2.14. Western blot
The brains were washed with ice-cold PBS and powdered in liquid nitrogen, was suspended in the cytobuster buffer (Invitrogen) was used to detect the NMDAR, CaMKII, ERK, CREB, PSD95 and Synaptophysin. Protein concentrations of brain lysates were assayed using BCA reagent (BioRad, USA). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to 8% and 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels at 70 V, and were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Merck Millipore) at 300 mA for 90 min, and then blocked with 5% fat-free milk or BSA for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight with the primary antibodies at 4  C. Membranes were washed and probed with secondary antibody: goat anti-rat IgG, and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo-scientific). Protein signals were visualized using an ECL chemiluminescent HRP substrate detection system. The band intensity was quantified by ImageJ and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, USA). The membranes were stripped and reprobed for B-actin (Sigma) (1:10,000) as an internal control.
2.15. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS statistical package version 18.0. The results are expressed as Mean +- SD and the data were analyzed by the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Turkey's multiple comparison tests when there is a significant 'F' test ratio. The level of significance was fixed at p <= 0.05.
