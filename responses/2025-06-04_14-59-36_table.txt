Materials and methods
Plant materials
Fresh leaves of M. oleifera were collected locally from Institute of Bioscience (IBS), Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), between April to May 2017. The collected leaves were washed thoroughly to take away any dust and soil deposits. It was then air dried under shade at room temperature for 5 days to get rid of the moisture content. Thereafter, the dried leaves were ground to a fine powder (1.0 mm) using an electric Laboratory grinder. The dry matter content (DMC) and the percentage yield (biomass) of the plant's leaves were calculated as follows:
Botanical identification
The plant was botanically identified at the IBS, UPM, by Dr. Mohd Firdaus Ismail, where the kingdom, family and species of M. oleifera was confirmed. The voucher specimens were deposited in herbarium IBS, UPM (SK3168/17).
Extraction procedure
The extraction method described by was employed in this study with modifications. The dried powdered leaves were extracted using 70% ethanol (hydroethanolic solvent) at the ratio of 1:10, that is, 100 g of M. oleifera (powdered leaves) was dissolved in 1000 mL of 70% ethanol in a clean glass flask. The flask was covered with aluminium foil and sonicated at 25 C for 30 min using ultrasonic bath kudos (SK8210HP) sonicator. Following sonication process, Whatman number one filter paper in Buchner funnel was used to filter the extract using suction pump and concentrated using rotary evaporator (Heildolph Rotavac vario tec, Germany). The procedure was repeated two times to extract the phytochemicals as much as possible and the concentrated extract was combined. It was then freeze-dried using Laboratory freeze dryer (Scanvac CoolSafe 95-15 PRO, Denmark) and stored at -20 C until needed for further experiments.
Liquid chromatography-electrospray ion mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS)
Preparation of samples
Samples were prepared according to the method described by Aliyu et al.   About 1000 mg of powdered MOHE was dissolved into 1 mL of LC-MS-grade methanol and sonicated for 5 min at 25 C by Bransonic Ultra sonic cleaner (2510E-DTH, USA). The samples were later filtered using N Nylon (NY) 0.45 microm filter paper (Sartorius, Germany) into LCMS vials for further analyses.
Materials and equipment
Standard compounds used for this experiment were LCMS grade acetonitrile (ACN), formic acid, methanol (MeOH) and LCMS grade water. The compounds were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, USA).
High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation was performed using a Thermo Scientific  Dionex Ultimate 3000 LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with a Thermo Hypersil Gold aQ (1.9 microm, 100 mm x 2.1 diameter). A Thermo Scientific Q Exactive Focus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) equipped with a pump: HGP-3200RS, Autosmpler: WPS3000TRS, column compartment: TCC3000RS a degasser: SRD3400, DAD (Diode Array Detector), Orbitrap mass analyser with a heated-electrospray ionization (H-ESI II), and software of Xcalibur and Chromaleon was used for LC-MS and LC-MS/MS detection.
LC-ESI-MS/MS for compounds identification
The bioactive compounds in crude extract of MOHE were determined according to the method described by Coppin et al.   with modifications. Mobile phase containing solvents B and C in linear gradient was used for the liquid chromatography (LC) separation. Solvent B was 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in acetonitrile, while C was 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in water. The gradient was set as follows: 10-30% B in 20 min and 30% B in 20-30 min at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The injection volume was 10 microL and the UV detector was set at 254, 280 and 370 nm. The eluent was observed using a Thermo Scientific ion max API source (H-ESI II), under positive and negative ion modes and scanned from m/z 190 to 800. Needle voltages of 4.2 and 3.5 kV were respectively used for the conduction of (ESI) for positive and negative modes under optimum collision energy level of 30. Dry gas (99.999% high-purity nitrogen) was used at a capillary temperature of 320 C and a flow rate of 12 L/min. Nitrogen was used as nebulizer at 40 psi.
Ethical approval
Ethical approval for these studies (acute and sub-acute toxicity studies) was obtained from the Animal Ethic Committee (AEC) of Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI) (approval reference number: 20170717/R/MAEC00023).
Animal welfare
The present study followed institutional guides for humane animal treatment and complied with the relevant legislation, according to the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of MARDI.
Acute and sub-acute toxicity studies of moringa oleifera hydroethanolic leaf extract
The acute and sub-acute toxicity studies were conducted according to the principles of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines (OECD 425 and 407 respectively) with slight modifications. The studies were conducted at the Animal Metabolism, Toxicology and Reproductive Centre (AMTREC), MARDI, Serdang. Each mouse was placed in a polycarbonate plastic cage and acclimatised to the optimum housing conditions with temperature ranges between 22 C and 25 C, humidity within the range of 40%-70% and 12 h light/12 h dark cycle for 1 week. The cages were cleaned regularly, bedding and water were changed accordingly.
Ten female mice, at 8-week old were randomly divided into 2 groups A and B using randomised complete block design (RCBD), with 5 mice each. Group A served as the control group and was given distilled water, while mice in group B were fasted for about 3 h and administered with a single dose of 2000 mg/kg MOHE via oral gavage in the morning.   The weight of each mouse was monitored on day 0 (prior to the extract's administration) and then repeated weekly for 14 days. Changes in the body weight of each mouse in the treatment group were measured and compared with that of the control group. The extract was freshly dissolved in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) before being administered orally to the mice. Subsequently, mice in groups A and B had free access to water and commercial chow ad libitum and were observed for any signs of toxicity, behavioural changes (agitation, dullness, restlessness) and/or mortality for 14 days.
The sub-acute toxicity study was carried out according to OECD guidelines 407. Twenty five female 8-week-old mice were randomly divided using RCBD into five groups (A to E) of five mice each; group A was administered with distilled water and served as the control group, while groups B, C, D and E received 125, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg MOHE (dissolved in 5% DMSO) respectively. The extract was administered once daily in the morning for 28 days at a volume of 1 mL/100 g body weight. The mice were observed daily for any signs of toxicity and were sacrificed using CO2 chamber on the 29th day of the experiment. In both study, administration of the herb was through oral gavage (using stainless steel needle) to symbolise the normal consumption of the herb in animals or human.
Weekly body weight gain
The weekly body weight of the mice in each group was determined throughout the study period using electric weighing scale and recorded as described by Aliyu et al.   and Asyura et al.   The body weight gain was calculated weekly by deducting the average weight gain of each mouse in the preceding week from that of the present week.  
Collection of samples
The mice from both acute and sub-acute toxicity studies were respectively sacrificed humanely on days 15 and 29 of the experiments, using CO2 chamber (Labquip Sdn. Bhd, Malaysia). Blood samples were collected using 26-gauge needle and 1 mL syringe, from the heart into clean bottles containing anticoagulant [ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA)]. The blood samples were used for haematological and biochemical analysis.
Necropsy was conducted on each mouse and tissue samples were collected from liver, kidneys, heart, brain, spleen, lungs and uterus. The weight of these organs was determined and recorded, afterwards the organs weight ratios were calculated as described by Aliyu et al.  
Haematological analyses
The blood samples collected in anticoagulated (EDTA) tubes were transported in ice packs to the Haematology and Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia and analysed for complete blood count using an automated haematology analyser (ABC Vet , ABX Diagnostics, France). The parameters investigated included total red blood cells, total white blood cell, platelet count, haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Blood smears were prepared and stained with Wright stain and examined under a light microscope. Differential WBC count, the absolute values of each WBC type, packed cell volume (PCV) and plasma protein concentration were determined as described previously.
Plasma biochemical analysis
After the ETDA blood was processed for analysis of hemogram, the blood was centrifuged using a benchtop centrifuge (Centrifuge S417R, Eppendorf, CA, USA) for 15 min at 3000 rpm to obtain plasma. The plasma was further analysed by a completely automated clinical chemistry analyser (BioLis 24i Chemistry Analyzer, Japan) for urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine kinase (CK), total protein (TP), albumin (ALB) and globulins.
Histopathological analysis
The tissue samples collected from the liver and kidneys from each mouse at the end of the experiment were processed at the Histopathology Laboratory, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia according to the methods described previously. The tissues processed on the slides were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined under a light microscope at different magnifications of 40, 100, 200 and 400.  
Lesion scoring
Lesions including acidophilic hepatocytes, pyknotic, karyolitic and karyorrhectic nuclei, activated Kupffer cells, none-obstructive sinusoidal dilatation, degenerative (cytoplasmic vacuolation), regenerative and inflammatory changes were scored for each stained section of liver from both groups of mice. In the kidney, acidophilic epithelial cells, pyknotic nuclei, degenerative change (hydropic swelling), hyaline and epithelial casts formation were scored for each mouse. Methods of scoring and determination of severity of lesions in liver and kidney is showed on Table 1.
Statistical analysis
The results were expressed as mean +- standard error of the mean (SEM) and were accordingly subjected to students''t' test statistical tool (between two treatment groups) as well as one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical tool using *IBM *SPSS statistics 23 (IBM Corp., NY, USA).   Differences between groups were determined using tukey post hoc test   (between three or more treatment groups). However, the results from the histopathological lesion scoring were subjected to non-parametric Mann Whitney U test tool (between two treatment groups) and non-parametric Kruskal Wallis H test   (between three or more treatment groups). Statistical significant was set at p values < 0.05.

Above is the abstract of a research paper and a series of tables that are in it. For each table, indicate whether it is a table indicating biomarker data from an animal toxicity experiment or not with a 0, representing no, or a 1, representing yes, in a list separated by commas within angle brackets like so: <0,0,1,0,1>. For every answer you give, double check which table it relates to and verify its source. Do not include any other text besides your answer and do not add any other text inside the list except for the requested information.
