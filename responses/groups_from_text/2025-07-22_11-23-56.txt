# Abstract
Background
Bisphenol S (BPS) is the main substitute for bisphenol A (BPA), a well-known plasticiser and endocrine disruptor. BPS disrupts ovarian function in several species. Moreover, a few studies have reported that the effects of BPS might be modulated by the metabolic status, and none have characterised the granulosa cell (GC) proteome after chronic BPS exposure.
Objectives
This study aimed to decipher the mechanisms of action of chronic BPS exposure on the proteome of ewe GCs while considering the interaction between a deliberate contrasted metabolism and reproductive function.
Methods
Forty ewes were split into two groups with contrasted diets: restricted (R, n = 20) and well-fed (WF, n = 20). The R and WF ewes were subdivided according to the dose of BPS administered through the diet (0-50 microg/kg/day), forming four groups: R0, R50, WF0 and WF50. After 3-month BPS daily exposure, GCs were recovered during the pre-ovulatory stage and proteins were analysed by nano-liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.
Results
Chronic exposure to BPS affected the GC proteome differently according to the ewe metabolic status. Fifty-nine out of 958 quantified proteins were differentially abundant between groups and are mainly involved in carbohydrate and lipid pathways. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) identified four clusters of 34, 6, 5 and 14 proteins according to the BPS exposure and diet interaction. Pairwise comparisons between groups also revealed a strong effect of BPS exposure and diet interaction. Functional analysis of DAPs highlighted that BPS upregulated beta-glucuronidase (GUSB; p = 0.002), a protein especially able to deconjugate bisphenol glucuronides (BP-g). Moreover, among unexposed ewes, GUSB was detected only in well-fed ewes.
Discussion
Conjugation of glucuronides inhibits the oestrogenic activity of bisphenols. Upregulation of GUSB in ewes dosed with BPS would prolong the oestrogenic effects of BPS by deconjugating BPS-g into free BPS. In addition, literature has reported an up-regulation of GUSB in people suffering from obesity. Therefore, people suffering from obesity could be subjected to prolonged and aggravated exposure to BPS. These data highlighted the deleterious effects of BPS and its interaction with metabolic status.

Ethics
All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the European Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and approved by the French Ministry of Nation Education, Higher Education, Research and Innovation after ethical assessment by the local ethics committee Comite d'Ethique en Experimentation Animale Val de Loire (CEEA VdL) and INRAE consented to use the animals in this experimental protocol (protocols registered under APAFIS numbers 13965-2018042008519239v2 and 14014-2018030717477406v2).
Experimental design
A total of 40 primiparous Ile-de-France ewes (average age 2.5 years) were housed in a sheepfold from 2018 to 2019. The experimental design was described previously. Briefly, the ewes were divided into two groups with contrasting diets: restricted (R, n = 20) and well-fed (WF, n = 20). The diet was designed according to the INRAE recommendations for the growth and maintenance needs of adult, non-pregnant ewes. It consisted in varying the quantity of a wheat-based food supplement (Agneau-echange, AXEREAL Elevage, Saint Germain de Salles, France). The food supplement was distributed in the morning and the animals had free access to straw and water and minerals to lick. Ewes from the experiment groups were fed in order to reach the goal of a median BCS of 2 in restricted groups and of 4 in well-fed groups and the quantity was adjusted according to the mean of body weight of the group. Ewes in the restricted group were initially fed 50% of their maintenance energy requirements and, once the target BCS was reached, they were fed 80% in order to maintain the desired nutritional status. Ewes in the WF groups were fed 165% of their maintenance energy requirements until the end of the experiment. The BW (kg) and BCS (on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 corresponding to very skinny ewes and 5 to obese ewes) of animals were monitored once a month. Within each group, two subgroups were defined according to BPS exposure (0-50 microg/kg/day) for at least 3 month, 5.4 +- 0.1 months (range: 3.6-7.9 months. The BPS, purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Madrid, Spain), was added to the feed in the form of a powder mixed with the cereals. Thus, there were four groups: R0 and R50 for the restricted ewes, and WF0 and WF50 for the well-fed ewes. Between September and December, the oestrus cycle of the 40 ewes was synchronised with a vaginal sponge of progesterone (Chrono-Gest  20 mg, MSD, Beaucouze, France) for 11 days, followed by intramuscular administration of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG, Synchro-Part  PMSG 400 IU, CEVA Sante Animale, Libourne, France). Two days after PMSG administration, at the presumed time of the pre-ovulatory period, the ewes were slaughtered, and follicular cells of the dominant follicles were collected by aspirating the follicular fluid containing GCs. GCs were centrifuged and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then stored dry at -80  C until analyses. Blood samples (5 mL) were collected at the time of slaughterhouse bleeding in heparinised tubes (17 IU/mL sodium heparin, Vacutainer ; Becton Dickinson and Company, Le Pont de Claix, France), centrifuged (3,700 g for 30 min at 4  C) and plasma samples were stored at -20  C for further assay of glucose, NEFA, BPS and its metabolite BPS-glucuronide (BPS-g).
Plasma glucose, non-esterified fatty-acids BPS and BPS-glucuronide assays
Plasma glucose and NEFA were quantified individually (n = 80) on a 2 and 5 microL undiluted plasma sample, respectively, by colorimetric enzymatic methods using a Konelab 20 analyzer (Thermo Scientific, Gometz le Chatel, France) and kits provided by Bio-Merieux (Marcy-l'Etoile, France) and Thermo Scientific (Villebon sur Yvette, France). BPS and BPS-g concentration were quantified as previously describe using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry with an Acquity U-HPLC device coupled to a Xevo-TQ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters, SaintQuentin-en-Yvelines, France) operated with positive electrospray ionization and MRM mode. All samples were quantified on the same day. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was set at 0.5 ng/mL (2 nM) for BPS and 0.05 ng/mL (0.10 nM) for BPS-g.
Protein extraction and quantification
The GC pellet was resuspended on ice with 100 microL of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl + 2% sodium dodecyl sulphate [SDS] + 1X protease inhibitor). Then, it was sonicated (2 x 20 s, five times for each sample) and centrifuged (30 min, 10000 g, 4  C). The supernatant was transferred to a new tube kept on ice and stored at -20  C. The protein concentration was quantified using the colorimetric BC assay Protein Quantification kit (Interchim, Montlucon, France), following the manufacturer's recommendations. The optical density at 550 nm was measured with a Thermo LabSystems plate reader at 550 nm absorbance and with Ascent software for Multiskan equipment.
Preparation of GC samples for comparative proteomic analyses
After protein extraction and quantification, 50 microg of protein per sample was separated with 4-10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (80 V, 10 min and 180 V, 50 min). After separation, the gel was stained with Coomassie blue. It was cut into four strips for each track and washed in water and acetonitrile (1:1 [v/v], 5 min) followed by 100% acetonitrile (10 min). Reduction and cysteine alkylation were performed by successive incubation with 10 mM dithiothreitol in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (30 min, 56  C), then 55 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (20 min, room temperature, in the dark). The pieces were incubated with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate with acetonitrile (1:1 [v/v], 10 min) followed by acetonitrile (15 min). Proteolytic digestion was carried out overnight using 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate containing 12.5 ng/microL trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Diagnostics, Paris, France). The resultant peptides were extracted by incubation in 5% formic acid (with sonication). The supernatant was removed and incubated with acetonitrile and 1% formic acid (1:1 [v/v], 10 min). After a final incubation with acetonitrile (5 min), the supernatant was removed and saved. These two peptide extractions were pooled and dried using a SPD1010 SpeedVac system (Thermosavant, Thermofisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).
NanoLC-MS/MS
Peptide mixtures were analysed with on-line nanoLC-MS/MS as described previously. All experiments were performed on a dual linear ion trap Fourier-transform mass spectrometer (FT-MS) LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled to an Ultimate  3000 RSLC Ultra High-Pressure Liquid Chromatographer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) controlled by Chromeleon Software (version 6.80 SR13). The samples were desalted and concentrated for 10 min at 5 microL/min on an LCPackings trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100 C18, 75 mum inner diameter x 2 cm long, 3 mum particles, 100 A pores). The peptide separation was conducted using a LCPackings nano-column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 75 mum inner diameter x 50 cm long, 2 mum particles, 100 A pores) at 300 nL/min by applying a gradient of 2-45% B over 90 min. The mobile phases consisted of 0.1% formic acid, 97.9% water and 2% acetonitrile (v/v/v; A), and 0.1% formic acid, 19.9% water, 80% acetonitrile (v/v/v; B). The data were acquired using Xcalibur version 3.0.63 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA), in positive data-dependent mode in the 300-1800 m/z mass range. The resolution in the Orbitrap was set at R = 60,000. The 20 most intense peptide ions with charge states >= 2 were isolated sequentially (isolation width 2 m/z, 1 microscan) and fragmented in the high-pressure linear ion trap using the collision induced dissociation (CID) mode (collision energy 35%, activation time 10 ms, Qz 0.25). Dynamic exclusion was activated for 30 s with a repeat count of 1. The lock mass was enabled for accurate mass measurements. The polydimethylcyclosiloxane ((Si(CH3)2O)6, m/z 445.120025) ion was used for internal recalibration of the mass spectra MS/MS.
Protein identification and data validation
Ion searches were performed using the Mascot search engine version 2.7.0.1 (Matrix Science, London, UK) via the Proteome Discoverer 2.5 software (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) against the NCBI prot_Mammals database (2021/07). The search parameters included trypsin as the protease with two allowed missed cleavages and carbamidomethyl cysteine, methionine oxidation and acetylation of the N-terminal protein as variable modifications. The tolerance of the ions was set to 5 ppm for parent and 0.8 Da for-fragment ion matches. The Mascot results obtained from the target and decoy databases searches were analysed with the Scaffold Q + S v5.1.1 and Scaffold Quant v5.0.3 softwares (Proteome Software, Portland, OR, USA) using the protein cluster analysis option (assemblage of proteins into clusters based on shared peptide evidence). Peptide and protein identifications were accepted if they could be established with a probability of > 95%, in accordance with the Peptide Prophet and the Protein Prophet algorithms, respectively. Proteins were identified with a minimum of two unique peptides. Extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) is based on the normalised values of the intensities of the chromatographic peaks corresponding to the peptides of a protein. XIC data were log transformed (log10 precursor intensity). The names of clusters, redundant proteins, and potential contaminants (keratin from Homo sapiens and trypsin) were excluded from the lists. In addition, only Homo sapiens and the followed herbivorous species were retained: Ovis aries, Ammotragus lervia, Bison bison bison, Bos indicus, Bos indicus x Bos taurus, Bos javanicus, Bos mutus, Bos taurus, Bubalus bubalis, Camelus bactrianus, Camelus dromedarius, Camelus ferus, Capra hircus, Cervus elaphus, Cervus elaphus hippelaphus, Cervus hangul yarkandensis, Equus asinus, Equus caballus, Equus przewalskii, Muntiacus muntjac, Muntiacus reevesi, Muntiacus vaginalis, Odocoileus virginianus texanus, Odocoileus virginianus virginianus, Ovis canadensis nelson, and Vicugna pacos.
Drawing up a list of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs)
Regarding the proteins detected in all conditions, DAPs were identified after analysis of variance (ANOVA) on protein abundance (p <= 0.05) and t-test (p <= 0.05), when the fold-change (FC) between the two conditions was >= 2 or <= 0.5. Regarding the proteins present in one condition but not in the other, DAPs were identified after the chi-square test on the protein detection rate (p <= 0.05). Briefly, proteins were considered to be present in a biological sample when they were detected at least once in one of the three technical replicates. Proteins that were not detected in any biological replicate for a condition were tested using the chi-square test for the bisphenol effect (proteins quantified for exposed and unexposed animals regardless of diet) and the effect of diet (proteins quantified for restricted and well-fed animals regardless of BPS exposure), but also for pairwise analyses (R0 vs. R50, WF0 vs. WF50, R0 vs. WF0, and R50 vs. WF50). This yielded 17 proteins with a p <= 0.05 (chi-square test) for at least one of the comparisons (dose, diet or pairwise) and an average abundance (log10 precursor intensity) ranging from 5.94 to 7.58. For pairwise analyses, proteins with significant differences in the detection rate according to bisphenol exposure were added to the lists of DAPs for the R0 vs. R50 and WF0 vs. WF50 comparisons; likewise, proteins exhibiting significant differences in the detection rate according to diet effect were added to the lists of DAPs for the R0 vs. WF0 and R50 vs. WF50 comparisons. Proteins that responded only to the pairwise analysis (R0 vs. R50, WF0 vs. WF50, R0 vs. WF0, or R50 vs. WF50) were added to the corresponding DAPs lists.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed and a heatmap was generated by using the Rstudio software (version 2023.03.0 + 386). PCA on DAPs (both ANOVA and the chi-square test) were carried out using the FactoMineR and ggplot2 packages. The percentage on each axis (dimension) represents the total variance of data according to dimension 1 (horizontal axis) and dimension 2 (vertical axis). Heatmap and hierarchical clustering on DAPs (both ANOVA and chi-square test p < 0.05) were performed using the gplots package. For DAPs from the ANOVA, missing values (in one replicate among detected values in other replicates of the condition) were treated with the missMDA package. For DAPs from the chi-square test, missing values (in all replicates of a condition) were deliberately replaced by '1' because the XIC data were log-transformed (log10 precursor intensity), indicating the absence of detection.
Functional analysis and prediction of biological processes of DAPs
The overlaps of DAPs between the different conditions was visualised using the online tool jvenn (https://jvenn.toulouse.inrae.fr/app/example.html). Gene enrichment analysis was performed separately for each pairwise comparison. Because the O. aries genome contains less information than the H. sapiens genome, the latter was used as preferential database for functional analyses. Gene lists of DAPs were used as input into the Database for Annotation, Visualisation and Integrated Discovery (DAVID version 2021) for Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. GO terms associated with over-represented biological processes (p < 0.05) were considered significant. The Metascape Enrichment analysis tool was used to study the potential roles of DAPs (https://metascape.org/). The Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways associated with 958 quantified proteins and DAPs from the pairwise comparisons were investigated using the Proteomaps software (http://bionic-vis.biologie.uni-greifswald.de/). For each comparison, proteomaps were created from the highest log10 precursor intensity values of the overabundant DAPs in each pairwise comparison with a minimum FC >= 2 or <= 0.5. For the proteins quantified, proteomaps were generated by using the highest value from the four groups (R0, R50, WF0 and WF50).

Validation of the diet model and detection of BPS and its metabolite in the follicular fluid of exposed ewes
Ewe body weight (BW) and body condition score (BCS) differed significantly between the WF and R groups (Table 1). The mean BW and BCS of restricted ewes were lower than well-fed ewes, with a mean difference of 11 kg in BW (52.6 +- 1.2 kg vs. 63.5 +- 1.2 kg in restricted and well-fed ewes, respectively, p < 0.001) and almost 1 BCS point (2.05 +- 0.07 vs. 2.88 +- 0.05 in restricted and well-fed ewes, respectively, p < 0.001). Despite overfeeding (165% of their maintenance energy requirements), well-fed ewes were not overweighted (BCS = 2.88 instead of 4 for typical overweighted animals); however, the plasma glucose and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations were increased compared with the restricted ewes (glucose: 778 +- 50 vs. 657 +- 23 mg/L, p = 0.039; NEFA: 301 +- 54 vs. 168 +- 26 micromol/L, p = 0.035). Ewes in the R50 and WF50 groups were exposed to BPS for an average of 5.4 +- 0.1 months (range: 3.6 - 7.9 months) before sample collection. BPS and its glucurono-conjugate BPS glucuronide (BPS-g), a marker of internal BPS exposure, were detected in the plasma of all exposed ewes at the time of slaughter (i.e. 24 h on average after the last exposure; Table 1), with no difference regarding diet effect. BPS-g was detected in 3 among 20 unexposed ewes at a significantly lower level compared to BPS exposed ewes (p < 0.001).
Proteins identified in ewe granulosa cells (GCs)
A total of 958 proteins were identified by at least two unique peptides in GCs (Supplementary Table S1). Among these proteins, 641 proteins were common to all conditions (Fig. 1). There were 2 specific proteins identified that were common to the R0 and WF0 groups, 20 specific proteins common to the R50 and WF50 groups, 17 specific proteins common to the R0 and R50 groups and 9 specific proteins common to the WF0 and WF50 groups. The most abundant proteins among the 641 common proteins are mainly circulating/blood proteins (serum albumin, fibrinogen alpha chain, fibrinogen beta chain, fibrinogen gamma chain, immunoglobulin and haemoglobin) and structural proteins (histones and heat shock protein family A member 5; Supplementary Table S1). The 958 proteins identified in GCs are involved in metabolism, the processing of genetic or environmental information and the cellular organisation system (see Fig. 2).

Proteomaps were generated using the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Pathway gene classification. Functional categories and proteins are represented by polygons. The polygon areas illustrate the normalised abundance of proteins in each condition. Functions and related proteins are organised into common regions and coded using similar colours. R0 - restricted diet, no BPS, R50 - restricted diet and 50 microg/kg/day BPS exposure, WF0 - well feed diet, no BPS, WF50 - well feed diet and 50 microg/kg/day BPS exposure.
Global analysis of DAPs in GCs from restricted or well-fed ewes exposed or not exposed to BPS
To assess more specifically the impact of BPS exposure and of contrasting diets on protein abundance, PCA of the 59 DAPs (ANOVA and chi-square p <= 0.05; Supplementary Table S2) of the 16 GCs samples was performed (Fig. 3). The PCA explained 57% of the variance of the data (Dim1 at 37.9%, light and dark blue and Dim2 at 19.2%, turquoise and green). WF0 did not correlate well in this PCA with the horizontal or vertical axis as it was close to the center of the PCA. On the contrary, R0 (dark blue) was negatively correlated to the horizontal axis while R50 (light blue) is mainly positively correlated to the vertical axis. WF50 was positively correlated to the horizontal axis and negatively correlated to the vertical axis. There was therefore a clear discrimination between these 3 groups (R0, R50 and WF50) as they do not correlate with the same axis. Therefore, the difference between unexposed ewes or ewes exposed to BPS might be greater in the restricted groups. The heatmap representation shows the differences in significant DAPs after ANOVA and chi-square test (Fig. 4). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified four DAP clusters (C1 - C4): C1 (green) comprises 34 proteins (including FHIT, GUSB, VAPB and TTR) that were more abundant in BPS-exposed ewes (WF50 and R50) and WF0 than in R0. C2 (orange) comprises 6 proteins (including AKR7A2, FDFT1, HSDL1 and TNPO2) that were more abundant in BPS-exposed (WF50 and R50) than unexposed ewes. C3 (blue) comprises 5 proteins (including DCD, APOA1, CLEC3B and AMBP) that were more abundant in WF50 than in the three other conditions. Finally, C4 (pink) includes 14 proteins (including TST, NCSTN, SLC27A1 and PRKCSH) that were less abundant in the WF50 group compared with the three other groups (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2).
Principal component analysis of the 59 DAPs (ANOVA p <= 0.05) showing a separation of the 16 GCs samples between diet (light and dark blue: restricted (R); turquoise and green: well-fed (WF)) and BPS exposure (0-50 microg/kg/day). Each point represents a biological sample with a different diet, exposed or not to BPS (see legends for corresponding colour). The square in each confidence ellipse indicates the mean of the data for a given region. The percentage on each axis (dimension) represents the total variance of data (horizontal axis, dimension 1 and vertical axis, dimension 2). Ellipses represent the 95% interval of confidence for each group.
Each line corresponds to a DAP (ANOVA or Chi-square p <= 0.05). For a given protein, blue lines represent lower abundance, white lines represent median abundance, while red lines represent higher abundance values relative to the other conditions. Four groups of proteins were identified by unsupervised hierarchical clustering (multicoloured vertical bars on the left). Orange bars indicate groups with higher abundance in ewes exposed to BPS. Green bars indicate a group with lower abundance in R0, blue bars indicate groups with higher abundance in ewes WF50 while pink bars indicate a group with lower abundance in WF50. The proximity between proteins is illustrated by the hierarchical tree at the left side. R0 - restricted diet, no BPS, R50 - restricted diet and 50 microg/kg/day BPS exposure, WF0 - well feed diet, no BPS, WF50 - well feed diet and 50 microg/kg/day BPS exposure.
Pairwise comparisons of proteins in GCs from ewes exposed or not exposed to BPS and presenting contrasted metabolic status
Pairwise comparisons were performed on the lists of the 958 quantified proteins (t-test p <= 0.05 and FC >= 2 or <= 0.5; chi-square test p <= 0.05; Supplementary Table S2). Figure 5 shows the distribution and overlap of DAPs between the comparisons. The different comparisons showed relatively similar number of DAPs (34 for R0 vs. R50, 26 for WF0 vs. WF50, 37 for RO vs. WF0, and 48 for R50 vs. WF50). Most of the DAPs were specific to each comparison and there was no DAP shared among all the comparisons.
The gene symbols for the DAPs were used for GO enrichment analysis of biological processes with Metascape (Supplementary Figure S1). The R50 vs. WF50 comparison highlighted a higher number of enriched biological processes compared with the other comparisons (Supplementary Figure S1D). The functional enrichments of DAPs for R0 vs. R50 is related to metabolism and detoxification (carbohydrate metabolic process and cellular detoxification) and proper functioning of the cells (intracellular protein transport, intracellular chemical homeostasis, organic anion transport, negative regulation of amide metabolic process and of cell development; Supplementary Figure S1A). The functional enrichments of DAPs for WF0 vs. WF50 is related to cells and organism balance and development (protein localisation to nucleus, negative regulation of cellular component organisation and of the immune effector process, positive regulation of cell migration, chordate embryonic development, and protein maturation) or in metabolism (alcohol and carbohydrate metabolic process; Supplementary Figure S1B). The functional enrichment of DAPs for R0 vs. WF0 is related to oxidative stress (response to reactive oxygen species) and proper cell functioning (endoplasmic reticulum membrane organisation, electron transport chain, cellular homeostasis, regulation of vesicle-mediated transport; Supplementary Figure S1C). Finally, the functional enrichment of DAPs for R50 vs. WF50 is related to metabolism (generation of precursor metabolite and energy, carbohydrate derivative biosynthetic and metabolic process and lipid modification), the immune response (regulation of leucocyte migration and defence response to bacterium) and proper cell functioning (positive regulation of substrate adhesion-dependent cell spreading, small molecule biosynthetic process, mitochondrial transmembrane transport, maintenance of location, regulation of establishment of protein localisation, homeostasis of the number of cells, response to hypoxia and negative regulation of cell adhesion).
To decipher the impact of BPS, proteomaps of the DAPs for the R0 vs. R50 and WF0 vs. WF50 comparisons were generated by using the KEGG pathways database (Fig. 6A and B). One of the common functions between both comparisons is carbohydrate metabolism, including the beta-glucuronidase (GUSB), which is present in both proteomaps. This protein was detected in all BPS-exposed ewes (the R50 and WF50 conditions), whereas it was not quantified in the R0 samples and was detected in 50% of the WF0 samples (Supplementary Table S3). Another common protein, nucleoprotein translocated promoter region (TPR) - which is involved in the processing of genetic information, more specifically in RNA transport - is also found in both proteomaps (Fig. 6A and B). This protein was more detected in R50 and WF50 (75% detection rate) compared with R0 (25% detection rate) and WF0 (0% detection rate; Supplementary Table S3). The diet effect, visualised as R0 vs. WF0 and R50 vs. WF50, showed proteins that are mainly involved in lipid and glycan metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and purine and amino acid metabolism, including proteins like thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST), farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1) and bis(5'-adenosyl)-triphosphatase (FHIT). Both TST and FDFT1 were detected more frequently in restricted than well-fed ewes (Fig. 6C and D). TST was detected in 75% and 100% of R0 and R50 samples, respectively, whereas it was detected in 25% and 0% of WF0 and WF50 samples, respectively. Similarly, FDFT1 was detected in 75% and 100% of R0 and R50 samples, respectively, whereas it was detected in 0% and 50% of WF0 and WF50, respectively. On the contrary, FHIT was detected in 0% and 50% of R0 and R50 samples, respectively, whereas it was detected in 75% and 100% of WF0 and WF50, respectively, and was therefore found more often in well-fed ewes than in restricted ewes. Interestingly, proteins involved in oxidative stress were found in the R0 vs. R50 proteomaps, namely glutathione peroxidase 7 (GPX7), and in the R0 vs. WF0 proteomaps, namely NADH dehydrogenase 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 7 (NDUFA7). GPX7 was more abundant in R50 compared with R0 (FC = 15.6) and NDUFA7 was more abundant in WF0 compared with R0 (FC = 5.6; Supplementary Table S2). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP), a protein involved in the NF-kappa B signalling pathway; nicastrin (NCSTN), a protein involved in the Notch signalling pathway; and apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), a protein involved in the PPAR signalling pathway, were also found in the WF0 vs. WF50 and R50 vs. WF50 proteomaps. LBP was less abundant in WF0 compared with WF50 (FC = 0.34), and less abundant in R50 compared with WF50 (FC = 0.06). NCSTN was detected more frequently in WF0 (75%) compared with WF50 (undetected), and more frequently detected in R50 (75%) compared with WF50 (undetected). APOA1 was more abundant in WF50 compared with WF0 (FC = 2.35) and R50 (FC = 2.48). Lastly, ras-related protein Rab-5B (RAB5B) and ras-related protein Rab-5 C (RAB5C), involved in protein transport, were found in the R0 vs. R50 and R0 vs. WF0 proteomaps. They were more abundant in R50 (FC = 2.45 and 3.10, respectively) and WF0 (FC = 3.23 and 3.84, respectively) compared with R0.
Venn diagram shows the overlap of the DAPs from the pairwise comparisons (p-value t-test <= 0.05 and fold change ratio Log2(FC) >= 1 or <= -1; feed x BPS exposure) and histogram representing the number of proteins identified in each condition.
Protein maps were generated using the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Pathway gene classification. Proteomaps were created from the average of the quantification values of the overabundant or most detected DAPs in each pairwise comparison with a Log2(FC) >= 1 or <= -1 minimum. In the left column, functional categories are represented by polygons, and in the right column, proteins are represented by the same polygons. The polygons illustrate the normalised abundance of proteins in each condition. Functions and related proteins are organised into common regions and coded using similar colours.
