# Abstract
Background
Different strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) worldwide proved to have tumouricidal activity in several types of cancer cells. However, the possible anti-cancer activity of Malaysian NDV AF2240 strain and its mechanism of action remains unknown. The ability of cytokine-related apoptosis-inducing NDV AF2240 to treat breast cancer was investigated in the current study.
Methods
A total of 90 mice were used and divided into 15 groups, each group comprising of 6 mice. Tumour, body weight and mortality of the mice were determined throughout the experiment, to observe the effect of NDV and NDV + tamoxifen treatments on the mice. In addition, the toxic effect of the treatments was determined through liver function test. In order to elucidate the involvement of cytokine production induced by NDV, a total of six cytokines, i.e. IL-6, IFN-gamma, MCP-1, IL-10, IL12p70 and TNF-alpha were measured using cytometric bead array assay (plasma) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (isolated splenocytes).
Results
The results demonstrated that 4 T1 breast cancer cells in allotransplanted mice treated with AF2240 showed a noticeable inhibition of tumour growth and induce apoptotic-related cytokines.
Conclusions
NDV AF2240 suppression of breast tumour growth is associated with induction of apoptotic-related cytokines. It would be important to further investigate the molecular mechanism underlaying cytokines production by Newcastle disease virus.

# Methods
Methods
Incubation of embryonated eggs
Propagation of NDV virus was performed based on the method reported by Blaskovis and Styk. Embryonated chicken eggs aged 9 to 10 days were obtained from Linggi Poultry Farm, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Upon arrival, the eggs were sprayed with 70% ethanol and wiped thoroughly with tissue paper to prevent contamination. The eggs were then kept in a 37  C-humidified incubator for 24 h. The embryos were candled daily to monitor its viability. Same method was also used to determine the margin of air sac of the embryos, which were marked with a pencil prior to inoculation of the virus. All procedures were carried out under biological safety cabinet to minimize any contamination.
Virus source and seed virus dilution
The velogenic viscerotropic NDV strain AF2240 was isolated from a local outbreak in the late 1960s and was obtained from Institute of Bioscience of the Universiti Putra Malaysia. Preparation of seed virus depends on the number of eggs used. Briefly, 10-fold of virus dilutions were prepared. First, three centrifuge tubes were filled with 9 ml of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and the subsequent tubes were filled with 27 ml PBS. Approximately 1 ml of virus was filtered using 0.45 muM filter and added to the first centrifuge tube containing 9 ml PBS and suspended for several times to get 1 in 10 dilutions of the virus. By using a syringe, approximately 1 ml of the dilution was transferred to the second centrifuge tube before being suspended several times. This process was repeated until the third centrifuge tube. Finally, 3 ml of dilution from the third centrifuge tube was transferred to the fourth centrifuge tube containing 27 ml PBS to obtain a dilution of 10- 4 NDV AF2240 which was used for the inoculation of virus in the embryonated chicken eggs.
Virus inoculation
Virus was inoculated in the eggs as per the method used by Alexander with slight modification. A small hole approximately 1 mm in diameter was made using a sterile needle right above the air sac margin. By using a syringe, 0.1 ml of virus dilution was inoculated into each egg. Then the eggs were sterilized using 70% ethanol before using melted candle or sterile tape to seal the hole. The eggs were then kept inside the incubator and checked for dead embryos using candling after 48 h. The eggs, which found to have dead embryos were removed and kept in the refrigerator at 4  C. The eggs were monitored daily for 96 h or until 90% of the embryos died. All the eggs were kept in the refrigerator overnight to ensure that the blood vessel is constricted before virus harvesting process. This can avoid collection of blood during harvesting of the allantoic fluid.
Virus harvesting
The eggs were left under a biological safety cabinet at room temperature for 30 min to avoid excessive condensation on the shells once removed from the refrigerator. The eggs shells above the air sac were then removed and the membranes were punctured to collect the allantoic fluid. If there were any visible contamination, the eggs were immediately rejected. To confirm the presence of NDV in the allantoic fluid, a rapid test using chicken red blood cells was conducted. The allantoic fluids collected were kept in sterile tubes. Immediately after all the allantoic fluids were harvested, the clarification and purification of the virus was carried out.
Virus clarification and purification
In brief, the clarification of allantoic fluid was done at 6000 g, 4  C for 10 min by using a refrigerated centrifuge. The supernatants were then centrifuged at 20,000 rpm, 4  C for 3 h. Again, the supernatant was discarded while the pellet was re-suspended and dissolved in 1 ml NTE buffer (NaCl, Tris-HCl, EDTA, pH 8.0). In addition, 30, 40, 50 and 60% of sucrose gradients were prepared in ultra-clear tubes and kept overnight at 4  C. A few drops of virus in NTE buffer were added to the sucrose solution by using a sterile pipette until all the tubes were equally balanced. The tubes were then centrifuged at 38,000 rpm, 4  C for 4 h by using pre-cooled SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter, USA). After the centrifugation, observation and marking of the purified band of virus was made under inverted microscope. The band was collected and transferred into polyalomer tubes. The tubes were topped-up with NTE buffer and balanced before subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 rpm at 4  C for 2 h. The pellets obtained were dissolved in 1 ml NTE buffer and filtered using 0.4 mum filter. Finally, the suspensions were kept at -80  C until further use.
Preparation of chicken red blood cells for virus titration
Blood was withdrawn from the jugular vein of chicken by using syringe that filled with a mixture of PBS and EDTA to prevent the blood from clotting. The blood was transferred into 15 ml tube and topped-up with PBS, then centrifuged at 1000 rpm at room temperature for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the red blood cells were re-suspended in PBS and centrifuged again. This process was repeated for 3 more times. For virus titration purpose, 50 mul of the RBC was diluted in 100 ml PBS to get 0.5% suspension of RBC cell in PBS.
Haemagglutination (HA) test
For HA test, 2nd to 24th well of 96-well plate were filled up with 50 mul of PBS while the 1st well was filled up with 100 mul of purified virus. 50 mul of purified virus was transferred from the 1st well into the 2nd well to make a two-fold dilution and this continued until the 23rd well. Then, 50 mul of the 0.5% RBC suspension was added into all wells and left for 30 min at room temperature. The 1st well was served as positive control whereas the 24th well served as negative control. Any appearance of red button was observed in all wells except the 24th well that represented the virus HA titre.
NDV titre for treatment
Viruses were prepared from titre of 108 (28) where it was neatly harvested from chicken eggs. Then the viruses were diluted to 8 HA, 16 HA, 32 HA and 64 HA unit of NDV as described in the Table 1 below.
Cell culture
Mouse mammary tumour cell line (4 T1) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cell was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium that was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37  C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Culture medium was replaced every 2 to 3 days until the cell become 90% confluence before being subculture or used in the further experiment.
Animals and xenograft mouse mammary tumour model
Healthy BALB/c mice weighing 15-20 g of age between 6 and 7 weeks old were obtained from Institute of Medical Research (IMR, Malaysia). The animals were reared in the animal house of Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, where they were kept in a sterile plastic cage under hygienic conditions and were provided with food and water ad labium. Studies were conducted in Cancer Research Laboratory of Institute of Bioscience. All the animal works were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines for Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC), Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia. A concentration of 1 x 104 cells/ml (0.1 cc injection per mouse) was used to induced tumour in the mice. The animals were not subjected to any form of suffering during the induction process. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of 4 T1 breast tumour cells was made into the mammary gland by gently penetrating the skin. All animals used in this experiment were humanely euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation upon meeting the criteria for tumour burden usually considered to be >=150mm3.
Experimental design and NDV treatment
Total 90 mice were used in this study and they divided into 15 groups (10 allotransplanted and 5 normal) with each group consisted of 6 mice. The normal category comprised of 5 groups of mice that were treated with 8, 16, 32 and 64 HA NDV without xenotransplant of cancer cells (NDV), while, a group that is only treated with normal feeding (without NDV and cancer cells) was served as control (NC). On the other hand, another 10 groups were allotransplanted with 4 T1 breast cancer cells, which are under xenotransplantation category. Out of 10 groups, 4 groups were received 0.1 cc of 0.5 mug/ml Tamoxifen in combination with 8, 16, 32 and 64 HA of NDV, respectively (CNDV+T); another 4 groups were treated with 0.1 cc of 8, 16, 32 and 64 HA of NDV only (CNDV), respectively. A group of allotransplanted mice without subjected to any virus or tamoxifen was served as cancer control (CC), while, another group was only treated with 0.1 cc of 0.5 mug/ml tamoxifen was served as positive control (CT).
Tumour, body weight and mortality
The body weight and tumour weight of the mice were measured on the first and last day after inoculation with NDV and allotransplanted with 4 T1 breast cancer cells. The mortality rate of the mice for each group was also assessed every day until day 28 to determine the effect of NDV, NDV + Tamoxifen on the survival rate of the mice.
Analysis of liver function
For assessment of liver function, plasma enzyme activities of total bilirubin level, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were determined using an automated enzyme activity analyser (Beckman, USA).
Cytokine determination by Cytometric Bead Array (CBA)
Measurement of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Cat. No: 555240), interleukin-10 (IL-10) (Cat. No: 555252) interleukin-12p70 (IL-12p70) (Cat. No: 555256), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (Cat. No: 555138), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (Cat. No: 555260), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (Cat. No: 558874), were performed using a mouse inflammation cytometric bead array kits (CBA; BD Biosciences, Malaysia). The assay protocol was done strictly according to the manufacturer's instructions and the samples were analyzed with flow cytometer incorporated BD FACSComp  software.
Determination of cytokines by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Spot (ELISPOT)
Spleen cells suspension was prepared according to the method by Yang et al. with slight modified. Spleen was removed and placed in plates containing Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) under sterile techniques. Spleen was then cut into small pieces and mashed through a nylon sieve. Clumps and debris were removed by allowing them to settle down before the cell suspension was transferred to clean centrifuge tube. Cell suspension was then centrifuged at 200 g, 4  C for 15 min. Supernatant was discarded and cells were gently re-suspended with red cell lysing buffer in order to lyse erythrocytes. Again, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 200 g, 4  C for 5 min to remove cell debris and ghosts. After 2 washing in cold HBSS, the mononuclear cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion. Cell concentration was adjusted to the 1.5 to 3.0 x 105 cells/ml in cell culture medium and kept on ice until further use. The ELISPOT assays were conducted by using the IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-12p70 ELISPOT kit (BD Biosciences, Malaysia) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were run in quadruplicates. The numbers of spots were enumerated manually by inspection under a dissecting microscope and automated ELISPOT plate reader.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as Mean +- S.D. and analyses were done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 22). Comparison between groups was determined by ANOVA and Dunnet test as post-hoc analysis was applied. P < 0.05 was considered as significant.

Results
Effect of NDV on body weight and tumour weight in allotransplanted mice
All groups of mice showed significant increment in body weight compared with beginning stage (Table 2). On the other hand, the tumour in all groups increased in size, weight and no signs of regression at the end of the experiment except for groups CNDV8, 16, 32, 64, CNDV8 + T and CNDV16 + T (Table 2). The six groups mentioned above did not show any tumour growth at all. Thus, the percentage of inhibition was up to 100%. In contrast, groups CNDV32 + T and CNDV64 + T did not show any signs of inhibition, and it seems there is an enhanced tumour growth. CT group which was treated Tamoxifen, a reference drug, showed slightly weak tumour suppression of about 16.55%.
Liver function test
The activity of serum AST, ALT and the level of total bilirubin for all the treated groups are shown in Table 3. The level of total bilirubin for all groups, except for CNDV32 + T and CNDV 64 + T groups, showed no significant difference compared with the normal control group. Both treatments indicated a markedly elevated level of total bilirubin. In the case of enzyme activities, cancer control (CC), reference drug (CT), CNDV16 and CNDV64 + T significantly increased AST activity. This is especially apparent in the group treated with Tamoxifen (CT), which showed an increase one-fold higher than the normal control. On the other hand, groups CT, CNDV8 + T, CNDV32 + T and CNDV64 + T showed a significant increment of ALT activity as compared to normal control.
Cytokine analysis of the plasma/ serum by CBA assay
Approximately one milliliter of plasma/serum from mice was collected following CA Argmann and J Auwerx technique at week 1, 2, 3 and 4 from each group setting and cytokine concentrations were measured by CBA assay. A total of six different cytokines were determined, i.e. IL-6, IFN-gamma, MCP-1, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-alpha. Among all the cytokines that were measured, the concentration of IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-12p70 in the group of cancer control (CC) were found to have a significant increase throughout the four weeks compared with normal control. In addition, CC group was found to produce the highest level of IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-12p70 (54.2 +- 8.7 pg/ml, 40.1 +- 2.4 pg/ml, 11.2 +- 2.9 pg/ml of, respectively), compared to normal control which are only 9.5 +- 1.2 pg/ml, 4.1 +- 0.1 pg/ml and 0.8 +- 0.1 pg/ml, respectively [Additional file 1: Table S1, Additional file 2: Table S2, Additional file 3: Table S3]. On the other hand, CC, CT, CNDV8, 16, 32 and 64 significantly produced IL-10 throughout the four weeks. However, production of IL-10 by group CNDV 16 ceased in week 3 and 4 [Additional file 4: Table S4]. There is no expression of IL-10 in the group NDV8-64. Apart from that, CC, CT, CNDV16 + T, CNDV32 + T and CNDV64 + T showed relatively high secretion of TNF-alpha throughout the experiment [Additional file 5: Table S5]. In the case of IFN-gamma, all groups showed varying results in different week and consider relatively low production [Additional file 6: Table S6].
Detection of spleen produced-cytokine by ELISPOT
To determine the role of NDV virus induced - cytokines in suppressing 4 T1 breast cancer, mice splenocytes cytokine production was measured after inoculation with NDV virus throughout the experimental period. Cancer control group (CC) possessed relatively high secretion of IL-6, IFN-gamma, MCP-1, IL-10, IL-12p70 and TNF-alpha from week 1 until week 4 compared with other groups [Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6]. Groups that were treated with NDV virus alone did not show any significant difference compared with normal control (NC) group in all the cytokine measurement. In the case of all the transplanted category, group treated with virus alone (CNDV) secreted relatively high level of cytokines when compared with the group treated with combination of virus and tamoxifen (CNDV+T). On the other hand, there was no cytokines observed in normal control group.
