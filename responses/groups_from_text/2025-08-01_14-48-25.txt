# Abstract
N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP) is produced up to several thousand tons per year as starting material for the production of polymers to be used in pharmaceutics, cosmetics and food technology. Upon inhalation NVP was carcinogenic in the rat, liver tumor formation is starting already at the rather low concentration of 5 ppm. Hence, differentiation whether NVP is a genotoxic carcinogen (presumed to generally have no dose threshold for the carcinogenic activity) or a non-genotoxic carcinogen (with a potentially definable threshold) is highly important. In the present study, therefore, the existing genotoxicity investigations on NVP (all showing consistently negative results) were extended and complemented with investigations on possible alternative mechanisms, which also all proved negative. All tests were performed in the same species (rat) using the same route of exposure (inhalation) and the same doses of NVP (5, 10 and 20 ppm) as had been used in the positive carcinogenicity test. Specifically, the tests included an ex vivo Comet assay (so far not available) and an ex vivo micronucleus test (in contrast to the already available micronucleus test in mice here in the same species and by the same route of application as in the bioassay which had shown the carcinogenicity), tests on oxidative stress (non-protein-bound sulfhydryls and glutathione recycling test), mechanisms mediated by hepatic receptors, the activation of which had been shown earlier to lead to carcinogenicity in some instances (Ah receptor, CAR, PXR, PPARalpha). No indications were obtained for any of the investigated mechanisms to be responsible for or to contribute to the observed carcinogenicity of NVP. The most important of these exclusions is genotoxicity. Thus, NVP can rightfully be regarded and treated as a non-genotoxic carcinogen and threshold approaches to the assessment of this chemical are supported. However, the mechanism underlying the carcinogenicity of NVP in rats remains unclear. 
# Methods
Materials and methods
Animals
The animal experiments described in this publication were approved by the responsible authority (Landesuntersuchungsamt Koblenz, Approval-No. G 13-3-042).
Eight-week-old male and female Wistar Crl:WI (Han) rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany and acclimatized for 10 days. They were kept at 20-24  C at a humidity of 30-70% in groups of six animals in polysulfone cages (Tecniplast) with free access to water and feed (10 mm pellets, Provimi Kliba, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland).
Inhalation experiments
The animals were acclimatized to the whole-body exposure chambers for 2 days using the inhalation stream without the test substance. After this, rats were assigned randomly to the following test groups: Six rats of each gender and at each dose level were exposed to 0, 5, 10 or 20 ppm NVP for five consecutive days 6 h per day, all of this in analogy to the carcinogenicity bioassay (Klimisch et al.). As positive control rats were once treated orally with ethyl methanesulfonate [200 mg/kg body weight (bw) dissolved in saline (0.9% NaCl)] and killed 24 h later. Animals were weighed before the 2-day acclimatation to the exposure chambers and subsequently before and after the exposure to the test substance. Animals were killed in the morning after the last exposure period to perform the examinations described further down.
For the inhalation experiments, two animals per cage (DK III, Becker & CO., Castrop-Rauxel, Germany) were kept in the glass-steel inhalation chambers (volume approximately 200 L) without access to feed and water. For each test dose a constant amount of NVP was pumped by continuous infusion pumps PHD Ultra (Havard Apparatus, Holliston) to an evaporator (Glasverdampfer BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany; Thermostat Julabo Labortechnik, Seelbach, Germany). The thus generated vapor was combined with air and introduced into the exposure chamber. This atmosphere then left the chamber via a reduced pressure exhaust system in order to ascertain avoidance of spurious contamination of the laboratory air potentially caused by a leakage of the system. The NVP concentration in the inhalation atmosphere was monitored by GC/FID (Agilent 6890 with autosampler, Dionex Chromeleon Software, column: ZB-WAXplus, Zebron, injection temperature 250  C, flow rate 1 mL/min, carrier gas helium, FID detector, retention time about 4 min).
Preparation of animal tissues
Animals were anesthetized by 3.5% isoflurane (approximately 3 min, evaporator Drager Vapor 19.3) and then killed by cervical dislocation. The liver was removed and its left lateral lobe used for the Comet assay. The remainder of the liver was washed in saline and then in two aliquots shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80  C for later examinations. Subsequently the lung was removed from the dead animal. Its left lobe was used for the Comet assay and the remainder treated as described above for the liver. Thereafter the femora were removed for the preparation of the bone marrow.
Genotoxicity
Micronucleus test
Cellulose columns
13-mm filter disks with a pore size of 8 microm were placed on the bottom of 5-mL plastic syringes. Approximately 500 mg of a mixture consisting of equal parts microcrystalline cellulose (Sigmacell , Typ 50) and alpha-cellulose fibers was added up to the 2-mL mark.
Bone marrow preparation
Bone marrow preparation was performed according to published methods (Romagna and Staniforth; Salamone et al.). The soft tissue was removed from the femora and the epiphyses were cut off. The bone marrow was rinsed off the diaphyses with approximately 3 mL 37  C-warm fetal calf serum (FCS) (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) per femur, placed on the above-described cellulose column and eluted with 3 mL of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) (with Ca2+ und Mg2+). The eluate was centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min and the pellet was suspended in 50 mL FCS. From this suspension three portions per femur were individually placed on slides, air-dried and then stained for 4 min in May-Grunwald solution 1 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), followed by 4 min in May-Grunwald solution 2 (May-Grunwald solution 1 diluted 1:1 with aqua bidest.), rinsed in aqua bidest and then stained with Giemsa solution (7.5% dilution derived from Giemsa obtained from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 15 min. Subsequently, the slides were washed twice with aqua bidest, then dried, cleared in xylene and covered with Corbit-Balsam (I. Hecht, Kiel-Hasse, Germany).
Evaluation
2000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) per animal (1000 per slide) were evaluated at 1000-fold magnification under immersion oil for the presence/absence of large and small micronuclei as well as the proportion of PCE among the total erythrocytes. Statistical significance of differences between treated versus untreated groups was evaluated by the one-sided Wilcoxon test (using the program MUKERN). The result is regarded as positive when the following criteria are fulfilled: 1. The number of PCE with micronuclei is statistically significantly and dose-dependently elevated; 2. the number of PCE with micronuclei exceeds the number in the present negative control group AND in the historical negative controls. The result is regarded as negative when the following criteria are fulfilled: The number of PCE with micronuclei is not statistically significantly greater than in the negative controls of the actual experiment AND lies within the historical negative control values.
Comet assay
The Comet assay was performed under alkaline conditions according to the principles described by Singh et al. and Tice et al..
Preparation of single cell suspensions
Liver and lung cells were obtained essentially as described by Hartmann et al. and by the Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (JaCVAM). Single cells were obtained within 1 h after killing of the animals in order to minimize DNA damage during the preparation.
The organ parts (see above) were washed in mincing buffer (50 mM EDTA in HBSS [without Ca2+ and Mg2+] pH 7.5: DMSO 9:1 (v/v), the latter added shortly before use, stored at 4  C), cut into 1 to 2-mm pieces in ice-cold mincing buffer and transferred to a cell sieve with 70-microm pores. The viability of the cell suspension was evaluated by the Trypan Blue Assay (Strober).
Preliminaries to the electrophoresis
100 microL of the obtained cell suspension was mixed at 37  C with 900 microL Low Melting Agarose (LMA) (0.7% agarose in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] [Biochrom, Berlin, Germany] without Ca2+ and Mg2+). 100 microL of this mixture was transferred to a slide, which had been coated with Normal Melting Agarose (NMA) (0.6% agarose in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+). The slides were protected with a cover slip and the agarose was hardened at approximately 4  C. The cover slips were then removed and the slides put over night at 4  C into lysis buffer (2.5 M NaCl, 125 mM NaOH, 127 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris/NaOH, pH 10; 1% Triton X-100 and 10% DMSO (v/v), the latter two added before use) in order to lyse the cell membrane, nuclear membrane and remove the histone.
The then following procedures were performed in a shaded room to minimize UV-mediated DNA damage during the procedures.
Those slides which were destined to be treated with the DNA base excision repair enzyme FPG (Sigma Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) were washed (3 times for 5 min) with FPG buffer (0.04 M HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 M KCl, pH 8; add shortly before use bovine serum albumin [BSA] to a final concentration of 0.02%). Subsequently 50 microL FPG-enzyme-buffer (prepared shortly prior to use by 30-fold dilution of the following suspension in FPG buffer: 7 microL FPG-enzyme (14 U) and 70 microL glycerol in 623 microL FPG-Puffer, stored at - 80  C) was pipetted on the slide which was covered with a cover slide and incubated for 30 min at 37  C while being placed on a humid filter paper. After hardening of the agarose cover slips were removed.
Remaining lysis buffer or FPG buffer was removed by immersing/washing the slides in PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+).
Electrophoresis
The slides were then placed into the electrophoresis chamber, which was cooled and protected from light. Slides were covered with electrophoresis buffer (0.3 M NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, pH > 13) carefully avoiding air bubbles. The DNA was allowed to unwind (20 min). Thereafter the electrophoresis was started (25 V, 300 mA, 0.85 V/cm2, 30 min). The slides were then washed (2 times 5 min) in neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris/HCl, pH 7.5), dehydrated and fixed in 100% ethanol (1 min), dried at room temperature overnight and stored at room temperature protected from dust.
Evaluation
Quantitative evaluation of the Comet assays was performed by fluorescence microscopy after DNA staining with ethidium bromide. 40 microL of a 0.0005% ethidium bromide solution was pipetted on the electrophoresed DNA carrying slide, which was then covered with a slip and immersion oil was added for microscopy. Counting and evaluation of DNA (comets-shaped and non-comet shaped) was performed semiautomatically using Comet Assay IVTM (Perceptive Instruments, Bury St Edmunds) at intensity grade 2 of the fluorescence microscope. 100 cells were counted per animal and per organ on two separate slides (50 per slide). Each of the two slides was evaluated by a separate person. The criteria of the Comet standardization atlas (Nakajima et al.) were carefully followed such as avoiding the inclusion into the evaluation of cells on the border of the slide as well as hedgehogs (diffuse cells without a discernible head). Hedgehogs were counted separately.
As basis for the evaluation of the DNA damage the relative tail intensity (TI) was used, providing relative fluorescence intensity in the tail and thus information on the amount of DNA in the tail which is linearly related to the amount of DNA strand breaks. Therefore, this parameter is recommended for DNA damage evaluation within the Comet assay (Collins et al.,; Hartmann et al.,; Lovell & Omori,). For obtaining the TI of the individual animal and organ the mean of the median TI per slide was calculated. These mean TI values per organ and animal were used to calculate the mean TI value per dose group.
A test substance is regarded as positive in the Comet assay, if the mean of the TI is dose-dependently increased and if the mean of the TI of a dose group is increased by a factor of 2 above the vehicle-only control group of the actual experiment. In difficult cases, if there is only a slight increase of the TI of some of the animals of the dose group, the decision is taken case by case. A statistical evaluation (two-sided t-test) was taken into consideration.
Oxidative stress
Non-protein-bound sulfhydryl groups (NPSH)
Determination of NPSH was performed according to the principle described by Ellmann (1958, 1959) in the liver homogenate supernatant fraction of the NVP-exposed male Wistar rats. One g liver was homogenized at 0  C in 9 mL of a 5% (weight/volume) aqueous 5-sulfosalicylic acid (5-SSA) solution, followed by centrifugation (14 000 g, 10 min, 4  C). The supernatant fraction was stored in aliqots at - 80  C. Prior to assay, the samples were diluted fourfold and to 100 microL of the diluted sample 200 microL Tris/EDTA (1 M/5 mM, pH 8.9) buffer was added. Determinations were performed in triplicates. As quality control 480 microM GSH was used, which was diluted by a factor of 5 for application in the assay. Reaction was started by addition of 5 microL of Ellmann's reagent (10 mM 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid [DTNB] in methanol, freshly prepared every day). Measurements were performed 5 min thereafter at lambda = 412 nm.
Glutathione recycling assay
Glutathione recycling assay was adapted from the method described by Gallagher and performed using the 14 000 g supernatant fraction derived from the 5-SSA-treated liver homogenate of the NVP-exposed male Wistar rats as described above under "Non-protein-bound sulfhydryl groups". The obtained samples were diluted fivefold with the 5% 5-SSA solution.
For determination of total glutathione (tGSH, i.e. GSH + GSSG) a GSH control (640 microM in 5% 5-SSA, diluted by a factor of 4 for application in the assay) and a tGSH control (200 microM in 5% 5-SSA, containing 10% GSSG) were treated the same way as the samples. To 5 microL of sample, controls as well as GSH standards (dissolved in 5% 5-SSA solution) 190 microL tGSH master mix, consisting of phosphate/EDTA buffer (125 mM KH2PO4/7 mM EDTA, pH 7.5), 0.4 mM NADPH and 0.5 U/L glutathione reductase suspension, were added. Determinations were performed in triplicates. The reaction was started by adding 5 microL of 24 mM DTNB in methanol. The absorption at lambda = 412 nm was measured every 60 s for 5 min.
For determination of GSSG a control (20 muM GSSG, 160 muM GSH) was treated the same way as the samples. 125 microL sample, control, GSSG standards and blank, respectively, were combined with 5 microL 2-vinylpyridine (Sigma Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). 20 microL of 7.4 mM triethylamine was pipetted to the upper rim of the vessel such that after mixing the pH value was between 7 and 7.5 and reaction was allowed to proceed in the thermomixer at 600 rpm for 1 h at 26  C in order to derivatize the GSH in the sample. The determination of GSSG was then performed in analogy to the determination of tGSH described above. The absorption at lambda = 412 nm was measured every 60 s for 10 min.
Receptor-mediated mechanisms
Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnan X receptor (PXR): Alkoxyresorufin O-dealkylase assays
The alkoxyresorufin dealkylase (AROD) assays were based on the method by Burke et al..
The frozen livers and lungs of the NVP-treated male Wistar rats were thawed and washed with isotonic (0.9%) NaCl solution. The tissues were ice-cooled homogenized (1 g tissue: 3 mL 0.25 M saccharose in 1 mM disodium EDTA, pH 7.4) and centrifuged (9000 g, 15 min, 4  C). The supernatant fraction was centrifuged (100 000 g, 60 min, 4  C). The resulting supernatant fraction was used for the palmitoyl-CoA-oxidase assay described further down. The pellet was taken up in 150 mM aqueous KCl solution, recentrifuged (100 000 g, 60 min, 4  C) and the pellet taken up in 1 mL/g liver or 0.5 mL/g lung resuspension buffer (1 mM GSH, 1 mM disodium EDTA, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M KH2PO4, pH 7.5 and 4% glycerol). Aliquots were stored at - 80  C.
For determination of the enzyme activities in triplicates, 85 microL master mix (100 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 2 mM 5'AMP, 5 mM G-6-P, 10 U G-6-P-DH, 10 mM Dicumarol, 10 mM MgCl2, either 2 microM EROD or 10 microM PROD or 5 microM BROD) was added to 10 microL microsomal fraction (1 mg protein/mL). The reaction was started by the addition of 5 microL 2 mM NADPH (dissolved in 100 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5) followed by incubation at 37  C for 16 min. The activity was determined by measuring the increase of the fluorescence (excitation at 550 nm, emission at 585 nm) due to resorufin formation compared with resorufin standards, which had been prepared by dissolving tenfold concentrated solutions in DMSO, which were then diluted tenfold in 100 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5.
As a method control the described AROD assay was performed with microsomal fractions derived from liver and lung of male Wistar rats which had been treated i.p. for 5 days with aroclor 1254 (500 mg/kg bw). These control assays were performed in presence of 1 muM, 10 muM or 100 muM NVP, respectively, in order to check for potential interactions of NVP with the substrate turnover in the AROD assay.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha):
a) Lauric acid hydroxylase assay
14C-labelled lauric acid (55 mCi/mmol) dissolved in ethanol (0.1 mCi/mL; total volume 2.5 mL) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. 10 microL of this solution were diluted with methanol to 2 mL. The purity was checked by radio-HPLC. For the enzyme activity determinations 1.21 mL of this solution were treated in the thermomixer at 40  C and 300 rpm until the ethanol was completely evaporated. The residue was taken up in 550 microL DMSO and checked on the incubation days by radio-HPLC and by liquid scintillation counting (LSC). To this end the just-mentioned solution in DMSO (nominally 8.14 MBq/mL) was 100-fold diluted with methanol, 50 microL of the resultant solution used for the HPLC analysis, 100 microL for the LSC analysis (488,400 dpm/100 microL).
For the determination of the lauric acid hydroxylase activity the liver microsomal fractions (prepared as described in the preceding chapter "Aryl hydrocarbon receptor") derived from the NVP-treated (and untreated control) male rats were adjusted with TrisHCl pH 7.5-20 mg protein/mL. Obtained samples were measured in duplicates. Controls were heat-denatured samples (15 min at 99  C in the thermomixer at 450 rpm), zero-time samples (reaction stopped immediately after adding substrate) and buffer controls (TrisHCl pH 7.5, no microsomal protein). 155 microL master mix (100 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM 5'AMP-Na2, 5 mM G-6-P, 10 U G-6-P-DH) and 30 microL sample were preincubated for 3 min at 37  C. Subsequently 10 microL of a 2-mM NADPH solution and 5 microL 14C-lauric acid (8.14 MBq/mL) were added (lauric acid final concentration in the incubation 100 microM). The reaction was run for 20 min at 37  C in the thermomixer (450 rpm) and stopped by the addition of 200 microL ice-cold acetone. Proteins were sedimented by centrifugation (6000 g, 10 min, 4  C) and the supernatant used for the analysis by HPLC (system: Agilent 1260 infinity, column: EC250/4 Nucleosil, 120-5 C18, radio detector: Berthold FlowStar LB 513) under the following conditions: Injection volume 50 microL; eluent A: Methanol/acetic acid/water (600/5/400 mL), eluent B: Methanol; gradient: 0-10 min 100% eluent A, 10-20 min 0-100% eluent B, 20-30 min 100% eluent B, 30-40 min 100% eluent A; flow rate: 0.8 mL/min. In order to ascertain the assignment of the peaks to 11-hydroxylauric acid versus 12-hydroxylauric acid the retention times and mass spectra (HPLC-QTOF/MS) of a 12-hydroxylauric acid standard were compared with the lauric acid incubates (parameters of the HPLC-QTOF/MS system: (U)HPLC: Agilent 1200 und 1290; MS instrument: MS324/Agilent/S/N US10318001; radio detector: Raytest/Mirastar Masshunter Data Acquisition B.06.01; ionisation mode: ESI, negative mode).
b) Palmitoyl-CoA oxidase assay
Cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl-CoA oxidase was determined essentially according to the method by Lazarow, specifically as follows:
Five microL of the liver cytosol (prepared as described in the preceding chapter "Aryl hydrocarbon receptor") derived from the NVP-treated (and untreated control) male rats were mixed in a centrifugal analyzer Cobas Fara II (Hoffmann La Roche) with 250 microL reaction mixture consisting of 28.2 mL 50 mM Tris buffer pH 8.01, 150 microL 2% Triton-X-100, 300 microL 1 mM FAD, 300 microL 10 mM CoA, 150 microL 1.5% BSA, 90 microL 0.33 mM dithiothreitol, 300 microL 20 mM NAD and after homogenization 300 microL 100 mM KCN. The reaction was started by adding 5 microL of 5.03 microM palmitoyl-CoA aqueous solution. The increase of the absorption at y = 334 nm due to NADH formation was determined and translated to palmitoyl-CoA oxidase U/L by the Cobas Fara II software.
Protein quantification and determination of levels of detection (LOD) and levels of quantitation (LOQ)
Protein was determined according to the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as standard except for the palmitoyl-CoA-oxidase assay where the Biuret method was used according to Gornall et al..
The limit of detection (LOD) was determined by adding 3 standard deviations (SDs) to the mean of the individual results. The limit of quantification was determined by multiplying the LOD by 2 (Gottwald).
Histological investigations of the liver
Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining
HE staining was performed essentially according to Romeis, specifically under the following conditions:
Parts of the frozen (- 80  C) livers from rats treated with 0, 5, 10 or 20 ppm NVP were thawed in formalin (specifically 4% formaldehyde in sodium phosphate buffer pH 7) and left therein for fixation at least 7 days. Subsequently the livers were cut into approximately 4 mm-thick slices, which were dehydrated in increasingly concentrated ethanol (70-100%), washed in xylene and then transferred into fluid paraffin. The livers were put into kassettes with the parts which were foreseen for cutting toward the bottom, the kassettes filled with paraplast (melting point 58-62  C) and the material left for hardening. From the embedded livers 3- to 6 microm-thick slices were cut by a rotation microtome, then stretched (in a water bath at 45  C), transferred to a slide and dried overnight at 50  C. Subsequently the slices were stained with HE and covered with Pertex. The slices were then microscopically evaluated. Structural changes were classified into severity grades 0, 1, 2 and 3.
Oil Red O (ORO) staining
ORO staining was performed essentially according to Lillie and Ashburn, specifically under the following conditions:
Parts of the frozen (- 80  C) livers from rats treated with 0, 5, 10 or 20 ppm NVP were soaked in tap water and then thoroughly frozen at - 40  C. Subsequently they were cut at -10 to -15  C into slices of 12-20 microm and stored in water until starting the staining procedure. The slices were then left for approximately 5 min in 60% isopropanol, subsequently stained for 10-12 min in ORO solution (5 g ORO dissolved in 1 L isopropanol, to this solution added 400 mL H2O, left at room temperature for 24 h and then filtered) and subsequently differentiated by immersing 2-3 times into 60% isopropanol. Afterwards they were left in water until they collected at the surface. Finally the slices were stained for 3 min in hematoxylin solution (1 g hematoxylin, 50 g KAl(SO4)2, 50 g chloral hydrate, 1 g citric acid/L H2O, then for maturation 0.2 g NaIO3/L). Subsequently they were left at least 10 min in water. Finally, the slices were transferred to microscope slides and covered with 40-60  C warm Kaiser's glycerol gelatin.
Gene expression analysis in cultivated rat hepatocytes
Isolation and cultivation of primary rat hepatocytes was performed according to a published standard operation procedure (Godoy et al. ) and Affymetrix gene array analysis as described in Grinberg et al.. Briefly, male Wistar rats with a body weight of 220-300 g were purchased from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). The animals had free access to food (sniff, Soest, Germany) and water and were kept under controlled temperature (18-26  C), humidity (30-70%) and lighting (12 h light/dark circle). Prior to any experimental procedure, the animals were acclimated for a minimum of 6 days. This study was approved by the local committee for the welfare of experimental animals and was performed in accordance with national legislation. RNA was extracted from cultivated primary hepatocytes as described by Heise et al.. Incubation of the cultivated rat hepatocytes with the test compounds was performed for 24 h. Rat hepatocytes were cultivated as sandwich cultures using 6well dishes. Three independent incubations with the test compound were performed. For Affymetrix gene chip analysis samples isolated from the 6-well dishes were stored in RNAprotect reagent from Qiagen until isolation of RNA. The RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop N-1000 spectrophotometer, and the integrity of RNA was confirmed with a standard sense automated gel electrophoresis system. Samples were used for transcriptional profiling only when their RNA quality indicator (RQI) number was > 8. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng total RNA using an oligo-dT primer with an attached T7 promoter sequence, followed by the complementary second strand. The double-stranded cDNA molecule was used for in vitro transcription (IVT, standard Affymetrix procedure) using Genechip 3' IVT Express Kit. During synthesis of the aRNA (amplified RNA, also commonly referred to as cRNA), a biotinylated nucleotide analogue was incorporated, which served as a label for the message. After amplification, aRNA was purified with magnetic beads and 15 microg of aRNA was fragmented with the fragmentation buffer as per the manufacturer's instructions. Then 12.5 microg fragmented aRNA was hybridized with Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Arrays. The chips were placed in a GeneChip Hybridization Oven-645 for 16 h at 60 rpm and 45  C. For staining and washing, Affymetrix HWS kits were used on a Genechip Fluidics Station-450. For scanning, the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner-3000-7G was used, and the image and quality control assessments were performed with Affymetrix GCOS software. All reagents and instruments were acquired from Affymetrix (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The generated CEL files were used for further statistical analysis as described in Grinberg et al., 2018).
# Results
Results
Exposure
Male and female Wistar rats were exposed by inhalation to NVP nominal concentrations equal to those which had been used in the carcinogenicity bioassay by Klimisch et al., 0, 5, 10 and 20 ppm, respectively. Table 2 shows that in the present experiments the achieved concentration levels in the inhalation chambers came satisfactorily close to the intended nominal concentrations: The mean concentrations averaged over the entire exposure period from day 1 to day 5 corresponded to the intended concentrations by >= 92%.
Clinical observations
None of the exposed rats died during the 5-day exposure. Only light clinical effects were noted: Red nose effluent (in 5 of 48 animals on days 4 or 5 of exposure), slightly increased salivation (in 1 of 48 animals on day 2 of exposure). Body weight increase was reduced in the mid-dose (10 ppm) males (p <= 0.05), and body weights were decreased in both genders (- 2.6 +- 2.5% and - 3.2 +- 2.6%, respectively) at the top dose (20 ppm) (p <= 0.01, 2-sided Dunnett test).
Histology
Histological examinations were not planned in this study, but in some livers of the males high-dose group there were already macroscopically some light spots visible. Therefore, the livers of three animals per dose and gender were histologically examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining. In most livers of the NVP-exposed rats centrilobular hepatocellular fatty change was noticed (but in none of the controls) (Fig. 2). This was the case in all males, except two of three investigated males in the low dose (5 ppm) group. In the intermediate dose (10 ppm) group, two of three males showed low-grade (grade 1) centrilobular hepatocellular fatty change, and in the high-dose (20 ppm) group, two of three males showed high-grade (grade 3) centrilobular hepatocellular fatty change. Females showed weaker effects: In one of three females of the high-dose group there was grade 1 centrilobular hepatocellular fatty change, and in one female of the high-dose group there was grade 2 centrilobular hepatocellular fatty change.
Lipid-staining (oil red O staining) of centrilobular hepatocellular fatty change was positive for only one male and one female animal in the high dose group, respectively.
Genotoxicity
Micronucleus test
The micronucleus test was performed according to the OECD guideline 474 in erythrocytes obtained from the femora of rats, which had been exposed during the 5 preceding days to NVP (via inhalation) or to the positive control substance, the known genotoxin EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate, 200 mg/kg body weight perorally applied). 2000 PCEs were analyzed for micronuclei per animal.
PCE of the vehicle-treated negative control animals had 1.8 +- 1.1% (males) and 2.3 +- 0.6% (females) micronuclei, corresponding to 2.1 +- 0.9% regardless of gender. This is not significantly different from the historical controls of the performing laboratory (0.7-3.6%) (obtained after inhalation or peroral treatment, which were not significantly different from each other). The number of micronuclei in the erythrocytes obtained from the positive controls, which had been treated with 200 mg/kg body wight of EMS, was 14.5 +- 6.0% in the erythrocytes obtained from males and 11.8 +- 2.3% in those obtained from females (13.2 +- 4.6% independent of gender) statistically significantly different from the negative controls (Wilcoxon-Test, p <= 0.01). The micronuclei observed in the EMS-treated positive control animals corresponded to the historical positive controls observed in the performing laboratory (6.1-21.9% after treatment with 200-300 mg EMS /kg body weight).
After treatment of the rats with 5 ppm, 10 ppm or 20 ppm NVP no significant increase in micronuclei in the PCE was observed. The mean number of micronuclei in NVP-exposed male and female rats varied from 1.4 to 2.9% (Table 3), which was within the range of the negative (vehicle) controls of the present study as well as of the historical negative controls. 
Thus, the doses which were carcinogenic in the rats did not lead to an increase in micronuclei in the rat bone marrow. Hence, no indication on a genotoxic (clastogenic or aneugenic) potential of NVP was apparent in the micronucleus test.
In addition, in normochromatic erythrocytes (NCE) no micronuclei were observed (neither in the vehicle-treated negative controls nor after exposure to NVP). This also corresponds to the historical negative controls in which maximally one micronucleus had been observed per 10 000 NCE.
The ratio of PCE to NCE was decreased by 10% in the high-dose males (Table 3) which suggests (but is not sufficient to unambiguously prove) toxicity-dependent perturbation of the maturation of PCE to NCE and, hence, of successful transport of NVP (or toxic metabolite(s) derived from it) to the bone marrow.
Comet assay
After exposure of the rats to NVP the Comet assay was performed in the lung, the organ of first contact with NVP, and in the liver, the target organ of the NVP-induced carcinogenicity of NVP.
Since cytotoxicity could interfere with the Comet assay and with the results obtained by its use and since the cells may be damaged by the procedures, their viabilities were determined by the Trypan blue assay. No cytotoxicity was apparent: the viabilities of the negative vehicle controls were 94 +- 2% und 95 +- 3% for the liver cells and 98 +- 1% und 99 +- 1% for the lung cells of male and female rats, respectively (range of the individual animals 91 to 100% for liver cells and between 97 and 100% for lung cells). Exposure to NVP did not decrease these viabilities, for individual animals lying between 90 and 99% for liver cells and between 93 and 100% for lung cells (range of the individual animals 90 to 99% for liver and 93 to 100% for lung cells (Tables 4, 5, 6, 7). Thus, viabilities were satisfactory for the target organ liver and for the organ of first contact, the lung, and no influence of the gender nor of the exposure to NVP nor of the technical procedure of cell isolation was apparent. All of this was also true for the exposure to the positive control compound, EMS (Tables 4, 5, 6, 7). 
Hedgehogs (comets with no or small head and long, diffuse tail), indications of cytotoxicity or extreme genotoxicity, were, compared with the negative (vehicle) controls not significantly increased in the lung or liver cells of both genders after treatment of the animals with NVP. Hedgehogs amounted in the NVP-treated lung cells to 1-7% and in the NVP-treated liver cells to 1-5% compared with vehicle-treated controls (Tables 4, 5, 6, 7). This was independent of performing the Comet assay in presence or absence of the DNA repair enzyme N-formyl pyrimidine glycosylase (NPG). However, treatment of the animals with the positive control substance, EMS, led in the assays in the conventional Comet assays (no FPG added) to approximately twofold increases of the number of hedgehogs: averaged for both genders from 3 5 to 7.5 and from 4.5 to 9 per 100 cells in the liver and lung cells, respectively (Tables 4, 5, 6, 7). In presence of FPG only hedgehogs were seen after treatment with EMS.
As measure for DNA damage the tail intensity (TI) (percent DNA in the tail) was chosen, since on grounds of its independence of the instruments and software used it is generally preferred and recommended by the OECD guideline 489.
The positive control substance (200 mg EMS/kg body weight) led in the conventional Comet assay (no FPG added) compared with the negative vehicle-control to statistically significant (p <= 0.01) and marked increases of the TI. These amounted in the liver cells to 27 and 28-fold in male and female animals, respectively and in the lung to 17 and 21-fold in male and female animals, respectively (Tables 4, 5, 6, 7). In the presence of FPG it was not possible to numerically define the increase of the TI after the treatment with EMS, but image analysis convincingly showed a marked increase (Fig. 3c, d).
In contrast to these marked increases upon treatment of the animals with the positive control substance EMS the treatment with NVP did not lead to significant increases as observed using the conventional Comet assay (no FPG added) (Tables 4, 5, 6, 7) nor in presence of FPG (Tables 8, 9, 10, 11). This was true for both genders in the liver (Tables 4, 5, 8, 9) and in the lung (Table 6, 7, 10, 11).
An unexpected observation was the decrease of the TI observed in the conventional Comet assay (no FPG added) in the male lung cells upon the 20 ppm NVP exposure and in the Comet assay variation with FPG in the male lung cells upon the 5 ppm and 20 ppm NVP exposure. Since a decrease was not observed under any other condition (not in male lung at other doses, not in male liver at any dose and not in any of the female groups, Tables 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), the result is considered biologically irrelevant (for further discussion see "Discussion" section).
Thus, no indication for an increase of the TI in the Comet assay and hence no indication of DNA strand breaks (conventional Comet assay without addition of FPG) or oxidative DNA damage or generation of apurinic sites (Comet assay in presence of FPG) upon treatment with NVP was obtained in the Comet assay at doses of NVP corresponding to those which had led to carcinogenicity (Klimisch et al.). Hence, no genotoxicity of NVP was observed in the Comet assay.
Oxidative stress
Since genotoxicity does not appear to be causative for the carcinogenicity of NVP (see above), oxidative stress, favoring oxidative damage to biological macromolecules including DNA, proteins and lipids, was investigated as a possible alternative mechanism leading to carcinogenicity.
To this end the concentration of (reduced) glutathione (GSH), the major biological antioxidant of the target tissue for the NVP-induced carcinogenicity, the liver, as well as its oxidized form, GSSG, and the sum of the two, "total glutathione" (tGSH), were determined in the liver of the NVP-exposed rat, the species in which the NVP hepatocarcinogenicity had been discovered (Klimisch et al.). The non-protein-bound sulfhydryl residues (NPSH), which in the rat liver consist mostly of GSH, were determined as approximation for the GSH concentration, while GSSG and tGSH concentrations were measured by the GSH recycling assay.
Table 12 shows the LOD, LOQ and recovery of the procedures used. Taking the dilution (20-fold) and the weight of the liver equivalent used (0.111 g/mL) into account it follows from the data in Table 12 (LOQ 144 nM) that 26 nmol GSSG/g liver correspond to the LOQ. Table 12 shows an LOQ of 98 nM tGSH in the well, which taking into account the dilution (assay 40-fold, sample fourfold) in this experiment and the weight of the liver equivalent used allows a quantification of GSH down to 140 nmol GSH/g liver. In the NPSH-assay the LOQ was 2.1 microM in the well corresponding to 230 nmol/g liver, hence slightly higher than in the recycling assay, but in the same order of magnitude. 
The precision of the procedures used were examined by determination of the recoveries. The mean recovery of GSH was 104% in the recycling assay and approximately 98% in the NPSH assay. In order to ensure that GSH and GSSG present in the recycling assay do not influence their determination a control solution was analyzed which contained at a tGSH concentration of 200 microM 10% of GSSG, since this represents approximately the ratio expected in the liver samples. In these control solutions the calculated mean recoveries were 99% for tGSH and 106% for GSSG (Table 12).
Exposure of the rats to NVP led to concentrations of GSH 3.72-5.23 micromol/g liver in the NPSH assay and to 3.06-5.48 micromol/g liver in the GSH recycling assay compared with control values of 3.76-5.10 micromol/g liver and 3.32-5.01 micromol/g liver in these two assays, respectively, upon exposure to vehicle only (Table 13). Mean GSSG concentrations were after treatment of the animals with 5 ppm NVP at 116 +- 32 nmol/g liver, after treatment with 10 ppm at 135 +- 12 nmol/g liver, after treatment with 20 ppm at 136 +- 22 nmol/g liver compared with 108-163 nmol/g liver in the vehicle control (Table 13).
The proportion of reduced glutathione GSH within the total glutathione tGSH as well as the GSH/GSSG ratio was determined using the GSH recycling assay. The former amounted to 94.1% +- 0.9%, 95.0% +- 1.4%, 93.9% +- 0.8% and 93.6% +- 0.9%, the latter to 32.6 +- 5.5, 42.2 +- 18.4, 31.2 +- 4.6 and 30.0 +- 4.6 in the vehicle control and in the 5 ppm, 10 ppm and 20 ppm NVP exposure groups, respectively.
Thus, no influence of the treatment of the animals with doses of NVP corresponding to carcinogenic doses (Klimisch et al.) on the concentrations of reduced or oxidized glutathione nor on the percent contribution of reduced glutathione to the total glutathione nor on the GSH:GSSG ratio in the rat liver was apparent. Hence, no indication of a contribution of oxidative stress to the NVP induced carcinogenicity was obtained.
Receptor-mediated mechanisms
Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) (AROD assay)
In order to investigate the potential involvement of hepatic receptor activation in the hepatocarcinogenesis of NVP the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the pregnane X receptor (PXR) were investigated by means of a potential activity increase of the respective alkyloxy resorufin dealkylase (AROD), ethoxy resorufin deethylase (EROD), pentoxy resorufin depentylase (PROD) and benzyloxy resorufin debenzylase (BROD) of male rat liver (target organ of the NVP-mediated carcinogenesis) and lung (first contact tissue of the NVP exposure) microsomes. EROD, PROD and BROD are mediated preferentially by CYP1A, CYP2B and CYP 2B/3A and were determined using their preferential substrates 7-ethoxyresorufin, 7-pentoxyresorufin and 7-benzyloxyresorufin, respectively.
Table 14 shows the LODs and LOQs of the AROD assays in the tissues investigated and Table 15 shows that the vehicle control values for AROD activities in the present study are reasonably close to historical control values and that induction of AROD activities are still well seen after storage at -80  C of rat liver microsomes up to 18 months. 
Liver microsomal EROD activities were after the treatment of the rats with 5 ppm, 10 ppm and 20 ppm NVP 20.5 +- 3.6 pmol/min/mg protein, 22.0 +- 5.8 pmol/min/mg protein and 16.9 +- 6.4 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively, compared with 19.3 +- 6.2 pmol/min/mg protein in the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 4), hence no indication of any significant change of CYP1A activities due to the treatment with NVP. The EROD activities were about tenfold above the LOQ of 2.0 pmol/mg protein and were close to the historical controls of 22-41 pmol/min/mg protein (n = 7).
EROD activities in the lung microsomes were after NVP treatment and in the vehicle controls below the LOD of 1.6 pmol/min/mg protein.
Liver microsomal PROD activities were after the treatment of the rats with 5 ppm, 10 ppm and 20 ppm NVP 12.4 +- 1.9 pmol/min/mg protein, 16.5 +- 4.3 pmol/min/mg protein and 10.0 +- 2.8 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively, compared with 12.8 +- 3.0 pmol/min/mg protein in the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 4), hence no indication of any significant change of CYP2B activities due to the treatment with NVP. All activities were above the LOQ of 6.2 pmol/min/mg protein and were in the same order of magnitude as the historical controls of 18-29 pmol/min/mg protein, albeit slightly lower.
PROD activities in the lung microsomes were below the LOD of 9.6 pmol/min/mg protein in 14 of 24 rats. It was not possible to calculate a mean PROD activity in the 5 ppm and 10 ppm NVP groups. The activities varied strongly and independently of the NVP exposure levels. The PROD activities in the high-dose (20 ppm NVP) group were not significantly different from those in the vehicle control group (Fig. 4). Hence, no indication of an influence of the NVP exposure on lung PROD activities was obtained.
Liver microsomal BROD activities were after the treatment of the rats with 5 ppm, 10 ppm and 20 ppm NVP, 54.5 +- 11.3 pmol/min/mg protein and 61.7 +- 16 pmol/min/mg protein and 42.1 +- 16.5 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively, compared with 48.1 +- 17.5 pmol/min/mg protein in the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 4), hence no indication of any significant change of CYP3A activities due to the treatment with NVP. All activities were approximately 40-55 above the LOQ of 1.1 pmol/min/mg protein and were in the same order of magnitude as the historical controls of 63-141 pmol/min/mg protein, albeit slightly lower.
BROD activities in the lung microsomes were after the treatment of the rats with 5 ppm, 10 ppm and 20 ppm NVP 22.9 +- 11.0 pmol/min/mg protein, 25.5 +- 19.8 pmol/min/mg protein and 82.1 +- 76.8 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively, compared with 60.7 +- 50.3 pmol/min/mg protein in the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 4), hence no indication of any significant change of CYP3A activities due to the treatment with NVP, albeit the interindividual variation was very large. All activities were above the LOQ of 3.6 pmol/min/mg protein.
It is not a priori completely excluded that some of the inhaled NVP may have bound to CYPs leading to suicide inhibition potentially masking enzyme induction. Table 16 shows that 1, 10 or 100 microM NVP does not lead to inhibition of EROD, PROD or BROD activities in Aroclor 1254-induced rat liver microsomes. All activities were above the LOQ.
In summary, in the liver microsomes of the male rats investigated all AROD activities were clearly above the LOQ and could reliably be determined. All activities were in the same order of magnitude as the historical controls. Treatment of the rats with doses of NVP which corresponded to those which were hepatocarcinogenic (Klimisch et al) did not lead to significant changes of AROD activities preferentially mediated by CYP1A, 2B and 3A, respectively, in the cancer target organ, the rat liver.
In the microsomes of the organ of first contact of inhaled NVP, the lung, also no significant changes of AROD activities upon NVP exposure were noticed, albeit many measurements suffered from very large interindividual variations and/or very low activities, some below the LOD.
Thus, no indications of AhR, CAR or PXR activation as possibly mediating or contributing to the hepatocarcinogenicity of NVP were obtained.
Peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha)
Activation of PPARalpha leads to non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents (Gonzales and Shaw). It was, therefore, investigated whether exposure of rats to hepatocarcinogenic doses of NVP (Klimisch et al.) leads to activation of PPARalpha by determining CYP4A activity which is regulated by PPARalpha. As model reaction for CYP4A activity the 12-hydroxylation of lauric acid in the microsomal fraction from high-dose (20 ppm) NVP-exposed male rats was used. In the same assay the 11-hydroxylation of lauric acid, which is mediated by CYP2E1, can also be determined. CYP2E1 mediates the metabolic activation of many pro-carcinogens (Oesch-Bartlomowicz and Oesch). It was, therefore, also quantified in the present study.
Introduction of a gradie4nt into the standard HPLC method allowed the separation of the 11-hydroxy lauric acid peak from the 12-hydroxy-lauric acid peak. Determination of LOD and/or LOQ was not necessary since all incubations led to easily quantifiable, clear peaks of hydroxylated products. In the negative controls (no protein or protein heat-denatured before or immediately after addition of substrate to the incubation mixture) no hydroxylated products were visible excluding a significant contribution of possible matrix effects or abiotic oxidation to the formation of hydroxylated lauric acid metabolites.
14C-lauric acid was used as substrate. Radio-HPLC confirmed its radiochemical purity and storage stability. Examination of its radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting showed a recovery of 100.4%.
Three peaks with the retention times of approximately 16.6 min, 17.4 min and 22.6 min resulted from all active incubations. 14C-lauric acid as reference identified the peak at 22.6 min as lauric acid. The two hydroxylated products were not available in radioactive form. Unlabeled 12-hydroxy lauric acid had a retention time of 16.1 min allowing the identification of the corresponding peak after active incubation of lauric acid. The third peak was tentatively identified as the second known hydroxylated lauric acid metabolite, 11-hydroxy lauric acid by its fragmentation pattern, which was similar to that of the 12-hydroxy lauric acid.
The enzymatic activity was expressed as the peak area divided by the incubation time (20 min) and amount of protein (in mg). This activity was 14.727 +- 5456 peak area/min/mg protein after the high-dose (20 ppm) NVP exposure of the rats compared with 10.983 +- 2236 peak area/min/mg protein vehicle-treated controls (Table 17). Hence the exposure may appear to lead to a slight increase of 1.3-fold. However, this slight increase was not statistically significant. Thus, these results do not show a NVP-induced PPARalpha activation. Yet, in order to go safe, these results were verified using palmitoyl-CoA-oxidase as a second marker of a PPARalpha-dependent enzyme activity as shown below. 
The 11-hydroxylation of lauric acid, catalyzed preferentially by CYP2E1, was putatively represented by the peak at 17.4 min retention time, which amounted to 5149 +- 2010 peak area/min/mg protein after the high-dose (20 ppm) treatment of the rats compared with 4512 +- 1050 peak area/min/mg protein in the vehicle-treated controls (Table 17) corresponding to a statistically not significant increase of 1.1-fold. Thus, no indication of a NVP-dependent increase of CYP2E1 activity was obtained.
A further marker of PPARalpha activation is the activity of cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl CoA oxidase/acyl CoA oxidase, the first enzyme of peroxisomal ss-oxidation.
After treatment of male rats with 5 ppm, 10 ppm or 20 ppm NVP the activities of cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl CoA oxidase in the liver cytosol were 5.43 +- 0.71, 5.47 +- 0.71 and 4.68 +- 0.71 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively, compared with 6.02 +- 0.49 nmol/min/mg protein in the vehicle-treated controls. Hence, all activities appeared reduced after NVP exposure, at the highest dose (20 ppm) even statistically significantly so. Thus, clearly there was no NVP-dependent increase. No indication for PPARalpha activation by NVP was obtained.
In summary, neither the results obtained with lauric acid as substrate of CYP4A nor those with palmitoyl CoA as substrate of cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl CoA oxidase support PPARalpha activation as cause of or contribution to the hepatocarcinogenicity of NVP.
Gene expression alterations in cultivated rat hepatocytes
To study a possible influence on gene expression, rat hepatocytes were cultivated and incubated with 8, 40, 200 and 1000 microM NVP for 24 h and genome-wide expression analyses were performed. Principle component analysis (PCA) showed expression changes already at the lowest concentration of 8 microM which continued up to the highest tested concentration of 1000 microM (Fig. 5). Genome-wide expression results were visualized in a principal component analysis (Fig. 5a) and the genes with the lowest false discovery rate (fdr) adjusted p values were summarized in the heatmap (Fig. 5b). Among the strongest upregulated genes were Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase 4 (PDK4; 8.8-, 5.9- and 3.5-fold at 1000, 200 and 40 microM, respectively; adj. p < 0.001), Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1; 7.3-, 6.2- and 3.5-fold at 1000, 200 and 40 microM, respectively; adj. p < 0.001) and Activating Transcription Factor 3 (Atf3; 7.1 and 5.1 at 1000 and 200 microM, respectively; adj. p < 0.001). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified ribosome biogenesis (adj. p value: 1 x 10-18) and rRNA processing (adj. p-value: 9.9 x 10-7) as the strongest enriched motives among upregulated and oxidation-reduction processes (adj. p value: 3.4 x 10-7) among upregulated genes. Thus, the results show strong gene expression changes at non-cytotoxic NVP concentrations (no cytotoxicity observed in MTT assay up to 1000 microM) (for upregulated and downregulated genes see Supplement 1 and 2, respectively).
