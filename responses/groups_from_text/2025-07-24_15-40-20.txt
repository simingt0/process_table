# Abstract
Here is presented a comprehensive investigation of the distribution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-stabilized AgNP (20 or 110 nm) in pregnant rats after a single injection or oral gavage dose. The biological impacts of AgNP exposure were evaluated by metabolomic analysis, and measurement of biomarkers of cardiovascular injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation. The investigation provided a basic understanding of the distribution, internal dose, persistence, metabolomics, and elimination of AgNP following exposure in pregnant rats.
Few investigations have been conducted on the disposition and fate of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) in pregnancy. The distribution of a single dose of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-stabilized AgNP was investigated in pregnant rats. Two sizes of AgNP, 20 and 110 nm, and silver acetate (AgAc) were used to investigate the role of AgNP diameter and particle dissolution in tissue distribution, internal dose, and persistence. Dams were administered AgNP or AgAc intravenously (i.v.) (1 mg/kg) or by gavage (p.o.) (10 mg/kg), or vehicle alone, on gestation day 18 and euthanized at 24 or 48 h post-exposure. The silver concentration in tissues was measured using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The distribution of silver in dams was influenced by route of administration and AgNP size. The highest concentration of silver (mug Ag/g tissue) at 48 h was found in spleen for i.v. administered AgNP, and in lungs for AgAc. At 48 h following p.o. administration of AgNP, the highest concentration was measured in cecum and large intestine, and for AgAc in placenta. Silver was detected in placenta and fetuses for all groups. Markers of cardiovascular injury, oxidative stress marker, cytokines, and chemokines were not significantly elevated in exposed dams compared to vehicle-dosed control. NMR metabolomics analysis of urine indicated that AgNP and AgAc exposure impact the carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism. This study demonstrates that silver crosses the placenta and is transferred to the fetus regardless of the form of silver.
# Methods
METHODS
Characterization of Silver Nanoparticle (AgNP)
In this study PVP-stabilized 20 or 110 nm AgNP, 1 mg Ag/mL in sterile water (Nanotechnology Characterization Lab [NCL] IDs NIEHS-2 and NIEHS-4, respectively), manufactured by nanoComposix, Inc. and supplied to the Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory (NCL) were used. The size and coating were selected by the NIEHS NCNHIR Consortium. The extensive characterization by NCL of the selected AgNP were done on behalf of NIEHS, including the determination of silver concentration in the provided solution. NCL assayed each preparation in duplicate for the following: Sterility and endotoxin contamination; hydrodynamic size/size distribution by dynamic light scattering (DLS); size/size distribution by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); hydrodynamic diameter (Z-average); surface charge by Zeta potential analysis and silver concentration by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the results are summarized in Table 1. Samples of NIEHS-2 and NIEHS-4 were obtained from NCL and stored refrigerated until time of use.
Housing and Dosing Administration of Pregnant Rats
Timed pregnant Sprague Dawley rats, approximately 10 weeks old were obtained from Charles River Laboratories in Raleigh, NC. Dams were singly housed in standard polycarbonate caging and were fed Purina 5002 rodent chow and Durham (NC) municipal tap water, ad libitum. A temperature of 72 +- 3  F, relative humidity of 30-70%, and a 12:12 light cycle were maintained in the animal rooms. Dams were acclimated for 5-7 days prior to dosing.
All doses were administered on gestational day (GD) 18. Dosing solution of AgNP were prepared by using AgNP suspensions as supplied and mixed well prior to administration. Silver acetate (AgAc) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was PVP-stabilized in 100 mug PVP/mL of water at a concentration of 1.55 mg/mL (1 mg Ag/mL). Rats were weighed before dosing, and the dose administered was determined by the syringe difference method. The charged syringe was weighed prior to dosing and the empty syringe was weighed after dosing. The exact dose administered was determined as the difference between the weight measurements. The AgNP and AgAc doses administered were calculated based on the weight of the dose administered and the concentration of the dosing solution. Dosing information was collected and calculated in a Debra  data collection and reporting system (LabLogic Systems Ltd., Sheffield, England). Intravenous doses (i.v.) were administered via a lateral tail vein at a concentration of 1 mg Ag/kg body weight, and oral doses were administered by oral gavage (p.o.) at a concentration of 10 mg Ag/kg body weight. Each dosing group had 6 dams. Control dams received vehicle doses of 100 mug PVP/mL in water at 1 mL/kg i.v. or 10 mL/kg p.o. The dose for i.v. administration was selected to be well under the lethal dose for i.v. exposure in mice of >200 mg Ag/kg. The dose of 10 mg/kg selected for p.o. is equivalent to 2000 times the reference dose for daily oral exposure to silver by EPA, but not toxic in mice at repeated daily doses. Dams were placed in glass metabolism cages that allow for separate collection of urine and feces on dry ice. Urine and feces were collected at 24 h intervals, prior to dosing (0h), 24 and 48h post administration. Three dams per group were euthanized at 24 and 48 h post exposure and tissues: blood, brain, heart, kidney, liver, spleen, lung, pancreas, stomach and small intestine (upper GI tract), large intestine and cecum (lower GI tract), skin, bone (femur), carcass, fetus, and placenta were collected, weighed, and stored frozen (-20  C). A portion of each blood sample was processed to plasma for biomarker analysis and the remainder was used for silver analysis. Blood volume in rats was estimated to be 7.4% of body weight based on the literature, muscles to be 40.43%, bones 7.3%, and skin 19.03%.
Measurement of Silver Content in Tissues
Quantitative analysis of silver in tissues and excreta was conducted by ICP-MS, adapted from methods described previously. In short, an aliquot representing about half of the organ was processed per sample except for GI tissues where the whole organ was processed with contents. For each set of digestions, method blanks were prepared and analyzed to monitor background silver content. Sample preparation was conducted in a room equipped with yellow lights to minimize the potential for photo-oxidation of silver. The silver concentration for all samples was analyzed using an X-Series I ICP-MS (Thermo Electron Corporation, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a concentric glass nebulizer and Peltier-cooled glass spray chamber. Quality control samples were processed with the study samples to monitor method performance, including pre-digestion spiked method blanks. The quantification limit was 0.5 ng Ag/mL digested solution, with a linear range from 0.5 to 100 ng/mL. Quantitation limits depended on the size of feces, urine, or tissue sample used for the digestion, and were approximately 50 ng/g for feces, 5 ng/g for urine, and 12.5 ng/g for liver.
Measurements of Cardiovascular Injury Markers and Inflammation
Levels of markers for cardiovascular injury and inflammation were measured in plasma samples collected from dams following exposure to AgAc, AgNP or vehicle control. To evaluate the cardiovascular injury concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, von Willebrand factor (vWF), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and soluble e-Selectin were measured quantitatively with a Milliplex MAP Cardiovascular Immunoassay Panel (RCVD1-89k, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Inflammatory markers counted eight chemokines and cytokines: Eotaxin, interleukins; IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which were quantified utilizing Milliplex MAP Cytokine/Chemokine and Cardiovascular Immunoassay panels (RECYTMAG-65K, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Assays were run according to the manufacturer's protocol, and analyzed using a Luminex 200 (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA). The results were reported using Luminex xPONENT  software version 3.1.
Detection of 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in Urine
Levels of 8-OH-dG in urine were measured using an ELISA assay, following the instructions of the (New 8-OH-dG-Check, Jaica, Japan; Supplier: Genox, MD, USA). Following centrifuged (10 min x 5,000 g), 30 muL urine was diluted with 120 muL PBS. For the assay a 50 muL aliquot of the diluted samples were used. Statistical analyses were performed using a Wilcoxon matched pairs test using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (San Diego, CA) and significant differences were p <0.05.
NMR Metabolomic Analysis of Urine
Metabolomic analysis was done on urine samples collected from dams at 48 h post exposure to vehicle, AgAc, 20 nm or 110 nm AgNP. The sample preparation for NMR metabolomics analysis has been described previously. In short, to 540 muL of urine, 60 muL of Chenomx ISTD solution (Chenomx, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) and two internal standards [4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS) and imidazole] were added. The internal standards were used for line shape analysis and chemical shift referencing, pH determination, and metabolite identification using the NMR library in Chenomx NMR Suite 8.1 Professional software (Chenomx, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). A 500 muL aliquot of sample was transferred into a 5 mm NMR tubes. A Bruker Avance III 700 MHz NMR spectrometer (located at the David H. Murdock Research Institute at Kannapolis, NC, USA) using the first increment of a NOESY sequence, with a 100 ms mixing time, a 2 s relaxation delay, a spectral width of 16 ppm, 32k data points, and 32 transients were used to acquire 1H NMR spectra. All 1H NMR spectra were collected at 25  C, zero filled, and Fourier transformed after exponential multiplication with a line broadening factor of 0.5. The water resonance was suppressed using resonance irradiation during the relaxation delay and mixing time. Phase and baseline of the spectra were manually corrected for each spectrum, and spectra were referenced to DSS (delta 0 ppm). Assessment of the quality of each NMR spectrum was done for the level of noise and alignment of identified markers.
Analysis of NMR spectra was conducted as previously described. Briefly, NMR data were processed by automated integration (increments of 0.04 ppm) over the spectral window (binning), excluding the region of water suppression, and DSS signal, and intensities each of the bins was normalized to the total integral of the bins of each spectrum. Normalized binned data (bin region and integral value) were transported for data reduction and visualization using SIMCA-P+ 13.0 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). SIMCA-P+ 13.0 for the binned data were used to generate principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Data were preprocessed by mean centering and Pareto scaling prior to multivariate data analysis. Loadings plots and variable importance for projection (VIP) plots were investigated to determine the bins that best define the separation of exposure groups and those bins were matched to metabolites using Chenomx NMR Suite 8.1 Professional software. The library matched marker metabolites that best differentiated the study groups were used for pathway mapping using MetaCore module in GeneGo (Thompson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA), and descriptive statistics were calculated using SAS 9.4.
# Results
RESULTS
Pregnant rats were exposed to three forms of silver: AgAc, 20 nm AgNP, or 110 nm AgNP in this comprehensive distribution study. Dams either received silver i.v. (1 mg/kg) or by p.o. (10 mg/kg). To compare with the distribution of silver ions, additional group of pregnant rats received AgAc at equivalent doses of silver (1 mg/kg i.v., 10 mg/kg p.o.). Following administration of silver and vehicle no adverse clinical signs were noted. To evaluate the distribution, internal dose, and persistence of silver, the total silver in tissues and excreta was determined by ICP-MS.
Distribution of Silver in Pregnant Rats after i.v. Administration
Tissue Concentration (mug Ag/g tissue)
The concentration (mug Ag/g tissue) of silver in tissues at 24 or 48 h post administration is presented in Table 2. The results demonstrated that the form of silver played an important role in tissue distribution. In dams receiving 20 or 110 nm AgNP, the highest concentration of silver was found in spleen at 48 h post exposure (1.1 mug Ag/g for 20 nm AgNP, and 3.6 mug Ag/g for 110 nm AgNP). In contrast, for AgAc dosed dams, the highest concentration of silver at 48 h was found in lungs (1.3 mug Ag/g). At 48 h post administration, the second highest concentration of silver in AgAc and 20 nm AgNP exposed dams was detected in placenta (0.8 mug Ag/g and 0.9 mug Ag/g, respectively), while for dams administered 110 nm AgNP, the second highest concentrations were found in liver (2.7 mug Ag/g), followed by the placenta (1.1 mug Ag/g). Silver concentration in liver was dependent on AgNP size, such that the concentrations of silver were an order of magnitude higher for 110 nm AgNP dosed dams (2.7 mug Ag/g) than for 20 nm AgNP (0.2 mug Ag/g). Silver was measured in fetuses for all three forms of silver and increased from 24 to 48 h post administration. The results show that silver crosses the placenta regardless of its form, and that the concentration is similar in the placenta between 24 and 48 h. However, the concentrations of silver in placenta were higher than the concentrations measured in blood, and also higher than the concentration measured in fetuses. Levels at least 3-fold above background were also detected in blood, liver, spleen, lungs, heart, kidney, bone, stomach and small intestine, cecum and large intestine, and pancreas for all three forms of nanosilver. Levels at least 3-fold above background were also detected in muscles and brain for AgAc and 20 nm AgNP, but not for 110 nm AgNP. Silver was not detected in adipose tissue at 48 h in any of the groups.
Recovery of Administered Dose
Dams dosed with 20 nm AgNP had the highest percentage of recovered silver in skin at 48 h (4%), whereas the highest percentage in dams administered 110 nm AgNP was found in liver at 48 h (12%) (Table 3). The percentage of silver recovered in skin at 48 h for dams that received AgAc and 110 nm AgNP were similar (5%). The levels of silver in the liver for 20 AgNP exposed dams were 1% at 48 h, 12-fold lower compared to 110 nm AgNP. For AgAc, the percentage of silver in the liver was 2% at 48 h. The percentage of silver recovered in placenta at 48 h was; 1.6-2.1% for all three groups, and 0.8-1.0% in fetuses. The percentage of dose detected in fetus and placenta were similar over the 24-48 h time interval for all groups, with the exception of fetuses of 110 nm AgNP dosed dams where the concentration increased. The percent recovery of administered dose at 48 h post i.v. and p.o. administration is presented in Table 4. The percentage of dose recovered in the tissues following i.v. administration was greater than an order of magnitude compared to recovery in tissues following p.o. administration.
Distribution of Silver in Pregnant Dams after Gavage Administration
Tissue Concentration (mug Ag/g tissue)
The highest tissue concentrations of silver 24 h after administration of both sizes of AgNP were found in the lower GI tract (3-4 mug Ag/g), which decreased (0.9 mug Ag/g) at 48 h (Table 5). The concentration of silver in the lower GI tract of dams administered AgAc was 16 mug Ag/g at 24 h and decreased to 0.4 mug Ag/g at 48 h, a 40-fold decrease compared to the approximately 3-4 fold decrease observed for both AgNPs. Besides the GI tract tissues, placental tissue was found to contain the highest silver concentration (0.9 mug Ag/g at 48 h for AgAc and 0.4 mug Ag/g for AgNPs). The concentration of silver at 48 h in fetuses of AgAc dosed dams was 2-fold higher than that of 110 nm AgNP dosed dams and 3-fold higher compared to 20 nm AgNP exposure. On average, the concentrations of silver found in placenta and fetuses were similar at 24 and 48 h for all three forms of silver. Fetus concentrations were generally an order of magnitude lower than the placental concentration, which was also observed for fetuses of i.v. exposed dams. The concentrations of silver in placenta were higher than in blood for all groups. Silver concentrations in fetuses were lower than those detected in the dams' blood at 48 h following AgAc and 20 nm AgNP exposure. With 110 nm AgNP, silver concentrations measured in blood of dams dosed were below the detection limit, however the silver concentration detected in their fetuses were similar to AgAc and 20 nm AgNP exposure groups.
Recovery of Administered Dose
The highest recovered percentage of dose in AgNP exposed dams was found in GI tract tissues, with higher recovery in the lower GI than in the upper at both 24 and 48 h (Table 6). The percentage recovered in GI tract decreased dramatically between 24 and 48 h, probably due to passage of the dose through the GI tract and elimination in feces. The second highest percentage for AgNP exposed dams was found in placenta (<0.2%), while for AgAc dosed dams placenta had the highest percentage (0.9%). The recovered administered dose in fetuses was <0.1%. Interestingly, the percentage of nanosilver was approximately 10-fold higher in the placenta compared to the liver, and several orders of magnitude higher than the kidneys.
Markers of Cardiovascular Injury, Inflammation, and Oxidative Stress
Markers of cardiovascular injury
Pregnant rats exposed i.v. to nanosilver were compared to time-matched vehicle groups at 24 and 48 h post exposure revealed that 110 nm AgNP caused a lower PAI-1 expression level (Table 7). For p.o. exposed dams, levels of PAI-1 were lower at 48 h for AgAc and 110 nm AgNP compared to vehicle. While the standard deviations were large, vWF levels in dams dosed i.v. with 110 nm AgNP exhibited a lower level of expression compared to vehicle exposed dams at 48 h, and AgAc showed an overall increase in vWF levels. For p.o. administered 110 nm AgNP, vWF was non-detectable at 24 h and lower than vehicle at 48 h. On average, the vWF and PAI-1 responses were lower for nanosilver administered p.o. compared to i.v.
Levels of inflammatory markers
Marker of inflammation in plasma were determine in pregnant rats receiving i.v. AgAc, 20 nm AgNP, or vehicle control at 24 and 48 h after administration, by evaluating the level of eight cytokines and chemokines (Table 8). While the standard deviations of cytokine and chemokine levels were high, the levels decreased from 24 to 48 h, and only eotaxin remained detectable at 48 h post administration in dams dosed with silver, but eotaxin, IL-4, and IL-6 increased from 24 to 48 h in dams receiving vehicle control.
Oxidative stress
Comparison between the three timepoints; predose (0 h), 24 and 48 h post dose, for the exposure groups vehicle control, AgAc, 20 AgNP, and 110 nm AgNP administered either i.v. or p.o. showed that 110 nm AgNP caused a significant elevation in 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) at 24 h compared to pre-exposure levels (Figure 1). There was an overall trend of increasing levels of 8-OH-dG from pre-exposure levels (0 h) to 48 h post exposure for all groups, including vehicle control. On average, the 8-OH-dG concentration were similar between i.v. and p.o. exposed dams.
NMR Metabolomics Analysis
Metabolomics analysis of urine collected at 48 h post dosing from pregnant rats administered AgAc, 20 or 110 nm AgNP, or vehicle control either i.v. or p.o. (Figure 2). Library matched metabolites that separate AgAc, 20 nm or 110 nm AgNP i.v. exposed dams from vehicle control dams, are listed in Table 9. Metabolites that distinguish AgAc, 20 nm or 110 nm AgNP p.o. exposed dams from dams receiving vehicle are listed in Table 10. It was found for both route of administration and forms of silver that there are common as well as unique metabolites that separate silver exposure groups from vehicle-dosed control.
In pregnant rats administered either form of silver (AgAc, 20 nm or 110 nm AgNP) i.v., the metabolites 1-methylnicotinamide, 3-hydroxyphenylacetate, citrate, glutamine, lactose, N-acetylglutamine, proline, and trigonelline differentiated the exposure groups from the vehicle control (Table 9). For dams receiving silver p.o., the metabolites isoleucine, lactose, and N-acetylglutamine separated all three groups from vehicle control (Table 10). In common for all silver exposed groups were that lactose and N-acetylglutamine separated them from vehicle control dosed dams (Tables 9 and 10).
The metabolites 1-methylnicotinamide, acetate, isoleucine, lactose, taurine, and trigonelline were differentiating metabolites in urine of AgAc dosed dams, regardless of route of administration (Tables 9 and 10). For 20 nm AgNP exposed dams a total of 15 metabolites were altered regardless of administration route compared to vehicle control (2-oxoglutarate, 3-hydroxyphenylacetate, acetoacetate, citrate, creatinine, dimethylsulfone, glucose, isoleucine, lactate, lactose, N-acetylaminoacids, N-acetylglutamine,N-acetylglycine, proline, and sucrose). Following 110 nm AgNP exposure the metabolites 1-methylnicotinamide, 3-hydroxyphenylacetate, allantoin, dimethylsulfone, lactose, N-acetylglutamine, proline, and trigonelline were found to separate both i.v. and p.o. dosed dams from vehicle control.
The most significant perturbed pathways as a result of i.v. exposure to AgAc and 20 nm, or 110 nm AgNP when compared to vehicle were: amino acid metabolism (involving the metabolites betaine, glycolic acid, L-glutamine, and L-proline), amino acid metabolism (involving the metabolites 2-oxoglutaric acid, glycolic acid, L-glutamine, L-methionine, and L-proline), and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism and transport (2-oxoglutaric acid, citric acid, and succinic acid), respectively (Table 11). When AgAc, 20 nm, or 110 nm AgNP were administered p.o. the most perturbed pathway for each exposure group compared to vehicle control were: carbohydrate metabolism, sucrose pathway (D-sucrose, D-glucose, and lactose), TCA metabolism and transport (2-oxoglutaric acid, citric acids, and succinic acid), and alanine, glycine, and cysteine metabolism and transport (glycolic acid and L-alanine), respectively (Table 11).
