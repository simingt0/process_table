# Instructions
You will be given the abstract, methods, and results of a paper with an animal toxicity study. Find each treatment group found in the paper that is related to an animal toxicity study. List each group and any parameters found in the following format on its own line, delimited by |: <group|species|n|terminal time|treatment1|dose1|units1|treatment2|dose2|units2>. group is the name given to the group (make up a short but descriptively unique one if the paper does not give one that is different from the others), species is the animal species (not the strain), and n is the sample size. terminal time is the time at which the group is euthanized/the metrics are measured. If the terminal time is used to distinguish between biomarker metrics rather than treatment groups, instead leave it blank. There are two slots for treatment medications, and in each, treatment is the medication name, dose is the numerical dosage amount, and units is the respective units. If there is only one treatment applied, leave treatment2, dose2, and units2 blank. If there is no treatment applied (ie. control group), leave all six parameters blank. Do not omit these from the list, just put the delimiters back to back with no whitespace like so: <control|mouse|10|30 days||||||>. If you are not sure of any of these, leave the space blank, and make sure to verify the source of your information before adding it to the answer. An example of a treatment group could look like this: <IBU100|rat|20||ibuprofen|100|mug/kg|||>.
# Abstract
In this study, HER2 RNA aptamers were conjugated to mertansine (DM1) and the anti-cancer effectiveness of the conjugate was evaluated in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer models. The conjugate of HER2 aptamer and anticancer drug DM1 (aptamer-drug conjugate, ApDC) was prepared and analyzed using HPLC and mass spectrometry. The cell-binding affinity and cytotoxicity of the conjugate were determined using confocal microscopy and WST-1 assay. The in vivo anti-tumoral efficacy of ApDC was also evaluated in mice carrying BT-474 breast tumors overexpressing HER2. The synthesized HER2-specific RNA aptamers were able to specifically and efficiently bind to HER-positive BT-474 breast cancer cells, but not to HER2-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Also, the HER2-specific ApDC showed strong toxicity to the target cells, BT-474, but not to MDA-MB-231 cells. According to the in vivo analyses drawn from the mouse xenografts of BT-747 tumor, the ApDC was able to more effectively inhibit the tumor growth. Compared to the control group, the mice treated with the ApDC showed a significant reduction of tumor growth. Besides, any significant body weight losses or hepatic toxicities were monitored in the ApDC-treated mice. This research suggests the HER2 aptamer-DM1 conjugate as a target-specific anti-cancer modality and provides experimental evidence supporting its enhanced effectiveness for HER2-overexpressing target tumors. This type of aptamer-conjugated anticancer drug would be utilized as a platform structure for the development of versatile targeted high-performance anticancer drugs by adopting the easy deformability and high affinity of aptamers.
