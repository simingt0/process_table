# Instructions
You will be given the abstract of a paper and a table representing animal toxicity data from a study in that paper. Your task is to identify the structure of the table in context of the study.
 1. Using the text and the table, identify what the treatment groups are and what the measured metrics are.
2. Observe how the table is oriented: do the groups go vertically, where each column corresponds to a treatment group and each row corresponds to a metric, or do they go horizontally, the inverse? Write <vertical> if vertical and <horizontal> if horizontal.
3. If the groups go vertically, are there any columns on the very left that should be combined? If so, add that to the end of the answer like so: <vertical|n>, where n is the number of columns that should be combined into one. If the groups go horizontally, skip this step and answer as so: <horizontal>.
# Abstract
In this study, HER2 RNA aptamers were conjugated to mertansine (DM1) and the anti-cancer effectiveness of the conjugate was evaluated in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer models. The conjugate of HER2 aptamer and anticancer drug DM1 (aptamer-drug conjugate, ApDC) was prepared and analyzed using HPLC and mass spectrometry. The cell-binding affinity and cytotoxicity of the conjugate were determined using confocal microscopy and WST-1 assay. The in vivo anti-tumoral efficacy of ApDC was also evaluated in mice carrying BT-474 breast tumors overexpressing HER2. The synthesized HER2-specific RNA aptamers were able to specifically and efficiently bind to HER-positive BT-474 breast cancer cells, but not to HER2-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Also, the HER2-specific ApDC showed strong toxicity to the target cells, BT-474, but not to MDA-MB-231 cells. According to the in vivo analyses drawn from the mouse xenografts of BT-747 tumor, the ApDC was able to more effectively inhibit the tumor growth. Compared to the control group, the mice treated with the ApDC showed a significant reduction of tumor growth. Besides, any significant body weight losses or hepatic toxicities were monitored in the ApDC-treated mice. This research suggests the HER2 aptamer-DM1 conjugate as a target-specific anti-cancer modality and provides experimental evidence supporting its enhanced effectiveness for HER2-overexpressing target tumors. This type of aptamer-conjugated anticancer drug would be utilized as a platform structure for the development of versatile targeted high-performance anticancer drugs by adopting the easy deformability and high affinity of aptamers.
