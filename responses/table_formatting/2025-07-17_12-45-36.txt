# Instructions
You will be given the abstract of a paper and a table representing animal toxicity data from a study in that paper. Your task is to identify the structure of the table in context of the study.
1. Using the text and the table, identify what the treatment groups are and what the measured metrics are.
2. Observe how the table is oriented: do the groups go vertically, where each column corresponds to a treatment group and each row corresponds to a metric, or do they go horizontally, the inverse? Write <vertical> if vertical and <horizontal> if horizontal.
