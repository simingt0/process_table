# Instructions
You will be given the abstract of a research paper which includes at least one animal toxicity study then a list of all the tables included in that paper, each one labeled with its title. For each table identify it as one of three categories: treatment group table (G), biomarker table (B), or other (O). Treatment group tables should contain information on the specific treatment groups, such as the medications, the dosages, the sample size, etc. Tables that only give information on the chemicals used (such as the sourcing) should not be labeled G and should instead be labeled O. Even if the table meets these criteria, only label the table G if it describes the groups of specifically an animal toxicity study within the paper. Otherwise, label it O. Biomarker tables may contain treatment group dosage information, but the main difference between is that biomarker tables should contain biomarker data observed from the treatment groups. This can frequency data (such as survival or number occurences of a condition) or metric data (such as ALT levels or compound concentration), and the table must describe the results of specifically an animal toxicity study within the paper to be labeled B. Otherwise, label it O. Any other irrelevant papers should be labeled O, such as results of in vitro assays or gene expression tables. For each table on a new line, include the label in the following format in the order that the tables are given: <table name|label>. Do not include any extra text in your answer or extra whitespace inside the labels. Here is an example input and output:

<abstract>Abstract
Background: Compound ABC is a novel small molecule with potential therapeutic applications in metabolic disorders. To evaluate its safety profile, we conducted two complementary toxicity studies: an in vitro cytotoxicity assay and an in vivo rodent toxicity assessment.
Methods:
In vitro assay: Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and rat cardiomyoblast (H9c2) cell lines were exposed to ABC at concentrations of 1-200 µM for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay, and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI staining and caspase-3 activation.
In vivo study: Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10 per sex per group) received daily oral doses of ABC at 0 (vehicle control), 10, 50, or 200 mg/kg for 28 days. Clinical observations, body weight, and food consumption were recorded. At study termination, hematology, serum biochemistry (ALT, AST, BUN, creatinine), and organ histopathology (liver, kidney, heart) were evaluated.
Results:
In vitro, ABC induced a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with IC₅₀ values of 45 µM (HepG2) and 120 µM (H9c2) at 48 h. Apoptotic indices increased significantly at ≥50 µM, accompanied by a 3-fold rise in caspase-3 activity. In vivo, no mortality or adverse clinical signs were observed at ≤50 mg/kg. Rats dosed at 200 mg/kg exhibited transient body weight suppression (5% lower vs. control), mild elevations in ALT and creatinine (1.4- and 1.3-fold, respectively), and minimal hepatocellular vacuolation on histology. No significant changes were seen in hematological parameters or cardiac histopathology.
Conclusions: ABC demonstrates moderate cytotoxicity in vitro, primarily via apoptosis, and is well tolerated in rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in this 28-day study is 50 mg/kg. These findings support further preclinical development of ABC, with emphasis on mechanistic studies of hepatic metabolism and long-term safety.</abstract>

<abstract>In this study, HER2 RNA aptamers were conjugated to mertansine (DM1) and the anti-cancer effectiveness of the conjugate was evaluated in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer models. The conjugate of HER2 aptamer and anticancer drug DM1 (aptamer-drug conjugate, ApDC) was prepared and analyzed using HPLC and mass spectrometry. The cell-binding affinity and cytotoxicity of the conjugate were determined using confocal microscopy and WST-1 assay. The in vivo anti-tumoral efficacy of ApDC was also evaluated in mice carrying BT-474 breast tumors overexpressing HER2. The synthesized HER2-specific RNA aptamers were able to specifically and efficiently bind to HER-positive BT-474 breast cancer cells, but not to HER2-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Also, the HER2-specific ApDC showed strong toxicity to the target cells, BT-474, but not to MDA-MB-231 cells. According to the in vivo analyses drawn from the mouse xenografts of BT-747 tumor, the ApDC was able to more effectively inhibit the tumor growth. Compared to the control group, the mice treated with the ApDC showed a significant reduction of tumor growth. Besides, any significant body weight losses or hepatic toxicities were monitored in the ApDC-treated mice. This research suggests the HER2 aptamer-DM1 conjugate as a target-specific anti-cancer modality and provides experimental evidence supporting its enhanced effectiveness for HER2-overexpressing target tumors. This type of aptamer-conjugated anticancer drug would be utilized as a platform structure for the development of versatile targeted high-performance anticancer drugs by adopting the easy deformability and high affinity of aptamers.</abstract>
