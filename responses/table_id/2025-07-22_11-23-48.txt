# Instructions
You will be given the abstract of a research paper which includes at least one animal toxicity study then a list of all the tables included in that paper, each one labeled with its title. For each table identify it as one of three categories: treatment group table (G), biomarker table (B), or other (O). Treatment group tables should contain information on the specific treatment groups, such as the medications, the dosages, the sample size, etc. Tables that only give information on the chemicals used (such as the sourcing) should not be labeled G and should instead be labeled O. Even if the table meets these criteria, only label the table G if it describes the groups of specifically an animal toxicity study within the paper. Otherwise, label it O. Biomarker tables may contain treatment group dosage information, but the main difference between is that biomarker tables should contain biomarker data observed from the treatment groups. This can frequency data (such as survival or number occurences of a condition) or metric data (such as ALT levels or compound concentration), and the table must describe the results of specifically an animal toxicity study within the paper to be labeled B. Otherwise, label it O. Any other irrelevant papers should be labeled O, such as results of in vitro assays or gene expression tables. For each table on a new line, include the label in the following format in the order that the tables are given: <table name|label>. Do not include any extra text in your answer or extra whitespace inside the labels. Here is an example input and output:

<abstract>Abstract
Background: Compound ABC is a novel small molecule with potential therapeutic applications in metabolic disorders. To evaluate its safety profile, we conducted two complementary toxicity studies: an in vitro cytotoxicity assay and an in vivo rodent toxicity assessment.
Methods:
In vitro assay: Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and rat cardiomyoblast (H9c2) cell lines were exposed to ABC at concentrations of 1-200 µM for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay, and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI staining and caspase-3 activation.
In vivo study: Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10 per sex per group) received daily oral doses of ABC at 0 (vehicle control), 10, 50, or 200 mg/kg for 28 days. Clinical observations, body weight, and food consumption were recorded. At study termination, hematology, serum biochemistry (ALT, AST, BUN, creatinine), and organ histopathology (liver, kidney, heart) were evaluated.
Results:
In vitro, ABC induced a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability, with IC₅₀ values of 45 µM (HepG2) and 120 µM (H9c2) at 48 h. Apoptotic indices increased significantly at ≥50 µM, accompanied by a 3-fold rise in caspase-3 activity. In vivo, no mortality or adverse clinical signs were observed at ≤50 mg/kg. Rats dosed at 200 mg/kg exhibited transient body weight suppression (5% lower vs. control), mild elevations in ALT and creatinine (1.4- and 1.3-fold, respectively), and minimal hepatocellular vacuolation on histology. No significant changes were seen in hematological parameters or cardiac histopathology.
Conclusions: ABC demonstrates moderate cytotoxicity in vitro, primarily via apoptosis, and is well tolerated in rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in this 28-day study is 50 mg/kg. These findings support further preclinical development of ABC, with emphasis on mechanistic studies of hepatic metabolism and long-term safety.</abstract>

<abstract>Background
Bisphenol S (BPS) is the main substitute for bisphenol A (BPA), a well-known plasticiser and endocrine disruptor. BPS disrupts ovarian function in several species. Moreover, a few studies have reported that the effects of BPS might be modulated by the metabolic status, and none have characterised the granulosa cell (GC) proteome after chronic BPS exposure.
Objectives
This study aimed to decipher the mechanisms of action of chronic BPS exposure on the proteome of ewe GCs while considering the interaction between a deliberate contrasted metabolism and reproductive function.
Methods
Forty ewes were split into two groups with contrasted diets: restricted (R, n = 20) and well-fed (WF, n = 20). The R and WF ewes were subdivided according to the dose of BPS administered through the diet (0-50 microg/kg/day), forming four groups: R0, R50, WF0 and WF50. After 3-month BPS daily exposure, GCs were recovered during the pre-ovulatory stage and proteins were analysed by nano-liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.
Results
Chronic exposure to BPS affected the GC proteome differently according to the ewe metabolic status. Fifty-nine out of 958 quantified proteins were differentially abundant between groups and are mainly involved in carbohydrate and lipid pathways. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) identified four clusters of 34, 6, 5 and 14 proteins according to the BPS exposure and diet interaction. Pairwise comparisons between groups also revealed a strong effect of BPS exposure and diet interaction. Functional analysis of DAPs highlighted that BPS upregulated beta-glucuronidase (GUSB; p = 0.002), a protein especially able to deconjugate bisphenol glucuronides (BP-g). Moreover, among unexposed ewes, GUSB was detected only in well-fed ewes.
Discussion
Conjugation of glucuronides inhibits the oestrogenic activity of bisphenols. Upregulation of GUSB in ewes dosed with BPS would prolong the oestrogenic effects of BPS by deconjugating BPS-g into free BPS. In addition, literature has reported an up-regulation of GUSB in people suffering from obesity. Therefore, people suffering from obesity could be subjected to prolonged and aggravated exposure to BPS. These data highlighted the deleterious effects of BPS and its interaction with metabolic status.
